Comments for future versions are welcome.\\n1. Executive Summary\\nA group of researchers met in Chicago in July, 1997 and in La Jolla in March, 1997 and February, 1998\\nto discuss the current state of the art of data mining and data intensive computing and the opportunities\\nand challenges for the future. The focus of the discussions was on mining large, massive, and distributed\\ndata sets. Here are the main conclusions of the workshops:\\nThe field of data mining and knowledge discovery is emerging as a new, fundamental research\\narea with important applications to science, engineering, medicine, business, and education. Data\\nmining attempts to formulate, analyze and implement basic induction processes that facilitate the\\nextraction of meaningful information and knowledge from unstructured data. Data mining extracts\\npatterns, changes, associations and anomalies from large data sets. Work in data mining ranges\\nfrom theoretical work on the principles of learning and mathematical representations of data to\\nbuilding advanced engineering systems that perform information filtering on the web, find genes\\nin DNA sequences, help understand trends and anomalies in economics and education, and detect\\nnetwork intrusion. Data mining is also a promising computational paradigm that enhances\\ntraditional approaches to discovery and increases the opportunities for breakthroughs in the\\nunderstanding of complex physical and biological systems. Researchers from many intellectual\\ncommunities have much to contribute to this field. These include the communities of machine\\nlearning, statistics, databases, visualization and graphics, optimization, computational\\nmathematics, and the theory of algorithms. \\nThe amount of digital data has been exploding during the past decade, while the number of\\nscientists, engineers, and analysts available to analyze the data has been static. To bridge this gap\\nrequires the solution of fundamentally new research problems, which can be grouped into the\\nfollowing broad challenges: A) developing algorithms and systems to mine large, massive and\\nhigh dimensional data sets; B) developing algorithms and systems to mine new types of data; C)\\ndeveloping algorithms, protocols, and other infrastructure to mine distributed data; and D)\\nimproving the ease of use of data mining systems; E) developing appropriate privacy and security'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='models for data mining.\\nThere is an important need for support by government and business of basic, applied,\\nmultidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in data mining and knowledge discovery in order\\nto respond to these challenges. \\nThere is an important experimental component to data mining and knowledge discovery which\\nrequires the creation and maintenance of appropriate systems, computational infrastructures and\\ntest beds.\\n2. What is Data Mining?\\nData mining is the semi-automatic discovery of patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, rules, and\\nstatistically significant structures and events in data. That is, data mining attempts to extract knowledge\\nfrom data. \\nData mining differs from traditional statistics in several ways: formal statistical inference is assumption\\ndriven in the sense that a hypothesis is formed and validated against the data. Data mining in contrast is\\ndiscovery driven in the sense that patterns and hypothesis are automatically extracted from data. Said\\nanother way, data mining is data driven, while statistics is human driven. The branch of statistics that\\ndata mining resembles most is exploratory data analysis, although this field, like most of the rest of\\nstatistics, has been focused on data sets far smaller than most that are the target of data mining\\nresearchers.\\nData mining also differs from traditional statistics in that sometimes the goal is to extract qualitative\\nmodels which can easily be translated into logical rules or visual representations; in this sense data\\nmining is human centered and is sometimes coupled with human-computer interfaces research. \\nData mining is a step in the data mining process, which is an interactive, semi-automated process which\\nbegins with raw data. Results of the data mining process may be insights, rules, or predictive models.\\nThe field of data mining draws upon several roots, including statistics, machine learning, databases, and\\nhigh performance computing.\\nIn this report, we are primarily concerned with large data sets, massive data sets, and distributed data\\nsets. By large, we mean data sets which are too large to fit into the memory of a single workstation. By\\nmassive, we mean data sets which are too large to fit onto the disks of a single workstation or a small\\ncluster of workstations. Instead, massive clusters or tertiary storage such as tape are required. By\\ndistributed, we mean data sets which are geographically distributed.\\nThe focus on large data sets is not an just an engineering challenge; it is an essential feature of induction\\nof expressive representations from raw data. It is only by analyzing large data sets that we can produce\\naccurate logical descriptions that can be translated automatically into powerful predictive mechanisms.\\nOtherwise, statistical and machine learning principles suggest the need for substantial user input\\n(specifying meta-knowledge necessary to acquire highly predictive models from small data sets). \\n3. Recent Research Achievements'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='The opportunities today in data mining rest solidly on a variety of research achievements, the majority\\nof which were the result of government sponsored research. In this section, we mention a few of the\\nmore important ones. Note that several of them are interdisciplinary in nature, resting on discoveries\\nmade by researchers from different disciplines working together collaboratively. \\nNeural Networks. Neural networks are systems inspired by the human brain. A basic example is\\nprovided by a back propagation network which consists of input nodes, output nodes, and intermediate\\nnodes called hidden nodes. Initially, the nodes are connected with random weights. During the training,\\na gradient descent algorithm is used to adjust the weights so that the output nodes correctly classify data\\npresented to the input nodes. The algorithm was invented independently by several groups of\\nresearchers.\\nTree-based Classifiers. A tree is a convenient way to break a large data sets into smaller ones. By\\npresenting a learning set to the root and asking questions at each interior node, the data at the leaves can\\noften be analyzed very simply. For example, a classifier to predict the likelihood that a credit card\\ntransaction is fraudulent may use an interior node to divide a training data set into two sets, depending\\nupon whether or not five or fewer transactions were processed during the previous hour. After a series of\\nsuch questions, each leaf can be labeled fraud/no-fraud by using a simple majority vote. Tree based\\nclassifiers were independently invented in information theory, statistics, pattern recognition and machine\\nlearning. \\nGraphical Models and Hierarchical Probabilistic Representations. A directed graph is a good means of\\norganizing information about qualitative knowledge about conditional independence and causality\\ngleamed from domain experts. Graphical models generalize generalize Markov models and hidden\\nMarkov models, which have proved themselves to be a powerful modeling tool. Graphical models were\\nindependently invented by computational probabilists and artificial intelligence researchers studying\\nuncertainty. \\nEnsemble Learning. Rather than use data mining to build a single predictive model, it is often better to\\nbuild a collection or ensemble of models and to combine them, say with a simple, efficient voting\\nstrategy. This simple idea has now been applied in a wide variety of contexts and applications. In some\\ncircumstances, this technique is known to reduce variance of the predictions and therefore to decrease\\nthe overall error of the model. \\nLinear Algebra. Scaling data mining algorithms often depends critically upon scaling underlying\\ncomputations in linear algebra. Recent work in parallel algorithms for solving linear system and\\nalgorithms for solving sparse linear systems in high dimensions are important for a variety of data\\nmining applications, ranging from text mining to detecting network intrusions.\\nLarge Scale Optimization. Some data mining algorithms can be expressed as large-scale, often\\nnon-convex, optimization problems. Recent work has provided parallel and distributed methods for\\nlarge-scale continuous and discrete optimization problems, including heuristic search methods for\\nproblems too large to be solved exactly.\\nHigh Performance Computing and Communication. Data mining requires statistically intensive\\noperations on large data sets. These types of computations would not be practical without the emergence\\nof powerful SMP workstations and high performance clusters of workstations supporting protocols for\\nhigh performance computing such as MPI and MPIO. Distributed data mining can require moving large'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='amounts of data between geographically separated sites, something which is now possible with the\\nemergence of wide area high performance networks.\\nDatabases, Data Warehouses, and Digital Libraries. The most time consuming part of the data mining\\nprocess is preparing data for data mining. This step can be stream-lined in part if the data is already in a\\ndatabase, data warehouse, or digital library, although mining data across different databases, for\\nexample, is still a challenge. Some algorithms, such as association algorithms, are closely connected to\\ndatabases, while some of the primitive operations being built into tomorrow’s data warehouses should\\nprove useful for some data mining applications.\\nVisualization of Massive Data Sets. Massive data sets, often generated by complex simulation programs,\\nrequired graphical visualization methods for best comprehension. Recent advances in multi-scale\\nvisualization allow the rendering to be done far more quickly and in parallel, making these visualization\\ntasks practical.\\n4. New Applications\\nThe discipline of data mining is driven in part by new applications which require new capabilities not\\ncurrently being supplied by today’s technology. These new applications can be naturally divided into\\nthree broad categories.\\na. Business & E-commerce Data. Back-office, front-office, and network applications produce large\\namounts of data about business processes. Using this data for effective decision making remains a\\nfundamental challenge. \\nb. Scientific, Engineering & Health Care Data. Scientific data and meta-data tend to be more\\ncomplex in structure than business data. In addition, scientists and engineers are making increasing\\nuse of simulation and of systems with application domain knowledge.\\nc. Web Data. The data on the web is growing not only in volume but also in complexity. Web data\\nnow includes not only text and image, but also streaming data and numerical data. \\nIn this section, we describe several such applications from each category.\\nBusiness Transactions. Today, businesses are consolidating and more and more businesses have millions\\nof customers and billions of their transactions. They need to understand risks (Is this transaction\\nfraudulent? Will this customer pay their bills?) and opportunities (What is the expected profit of this\\ncustomer? What product is this customer most likely to buy next?).\\nElectronic Commerce. Not only does electronic commerce produce large data sets in which the analysis\\nof marketing patterns and risk patterns is critical, but unlike some of the applications above, it is also\\nimportant to do this in real or near-real time, in order to meet the demands of on-line transactions.\\nGenomic Data. Genomic sequencing and mapping efforts have produced a number of databases which\\nare accessible over the web. In addition, there are also a wide variety of other on-line databases,\\nincluding those containing information about diseases, cellular function, and drugs. Finding\\nrelationships between these data sources, which are largely unexplored, is another fundamental data\\nmining challenge. Recently, scalable techniques have been developed for comparing whole genomes.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Sensor Data. Satellites, buoys, balloons, and a variety of other sensors produce voluminous amounts of\\ndata about the earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and lands. A fundamental challenge is to understand the\\nrelationships, including causal relationships amongst this data. For example, do industrial pollutants\\naffect global warming? There are also large terabyte to petabyte data sets being produced by sensors and\\ninstruments in other disciplines, such as astronomy, high energy physics, and nuclear physics. \\nSimulation Data. Simulation is now accepted as a third mode of science, supplementing theory and\\nexperiment. Today, not only do experiments produce huge data sets, but so do simulations. Data mining,\\nand more generally data intensive computing, is proving to be a critical link between theory, simulation,\\nand experiment. \\nHealth Care Data. Health care has been the most rapidly growing segment of the nation’s GDP for some\\ntime. Hospitals, health care organizations, insurance companies, and the federal government have large\\ncollections of data about patients, their health care problems, the clinical procedures used, their costs,\\nand the outcomes. Understanding relationships in this data is critical for a wide variety of problems,\\nranging from determining what procedures and clinical protocols are most effective to how best to\\ndeliver health care to the most people in an era of diminishing resources.\\nMulti-media Documents. Few people are satisfied with today’s technology for retrieving documents on\\nthe web, yet the number of documents and the number of people accessing these documents is growing\\nexplosively. In addition, it is becoming easier and and easier to archive multi-media data, including\\naudio, images, and video data, but harder and harder to extract meaningful information from the archives\\nas the volume grows. \\nThe Data Web. Today the web is primarily oriented toward documents and their multi-media extensions.\\nHTML has proved itself to be a simple, yet powerful language for supporting this. Tomorrow the\\npotential exists for the web to prove equally important for working with data. The Extensible Markup\\nLanguage (XML) is an emerging language for working with data in networked environments. As this\\ninfrastructure grows, data mining is expected to be a critical enabling technology for the emerging data\\nweb.\\n5. Success Stories\\nIn this section, we briefly describe some success stories involving data mining and knowledge\\ndiscovery.\\nAssociation Rules. Suppose we have a collection of items. The data for many applications consists of\\nmultiple transactions, where each transaction consists of one or more items. A basic example is provided\\nby a supermarket, where the items are the products offered for sale and the transactions are purchases,\\nconsisting of one or more products purchased by an individual at a given time. A fundamental problem\\nis to uncover associations: which products tend to be purchased together. There has been a lot of recent\\nwork on this problem and a variety of algorithms have been developed which can be discover\\nassociations, even in very large data sets, with just a few passes over the data. A variety of commercial\\ndata mining systems support association rules and they are now routinely applied to a range of problems\\nfrom database marketing to product placement for supermarkets. In addition, association rules\\nalgorithms have spurred new research in a variety of areas from databases to complexity theory. \\nFraud Detection. Although relatively few credit card transactions are fraudulent, the sheer volume of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='transactions means that over $500M are lost each year in this way. A variety of data mining techniques\\nhave been used to develop fraud systems which can detect fraudulent credit card transactions in\\nnear-real time. This problem is challenging due to the size of the data sets, the rarity of the events of\\ninterest, and the performance requirements for near-real time detection. Data mining has also improved\\nfraud detection in other application areas, including telcom fraud and insurance fraud. \\nAstronomical Data. Traditionally, the search for new galaxies, stars, and quasars has primarily been\\ndone by astronomers visually examining individual photographic plates. Classification algorithms from\\ndata mining have recently been used to automate this process yielding new astronomical discoveries.\\nThe classification algorithms are applied to derived attributes produced by image processing, such as the\\nbrightness, area, and morphology of sky objects. The approach has also proved useful for detecting new\\nobjects too faint to be observed by a manual analysis or traditional computational techniques. For the\\n2nd Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, this approach resulted in over a three-fold increase in the size of\\nthe catalog.\\nGenomic Data. Genomic data is stored all over the world, in a variety of formats and managed by a\\nvariety of applications and systems. Recently, systems have been developed which allow discoveries to\\nbe made involving information distributed over several systems. In particular, the new systems have\\nenabled for the first time whole genome comparison, gene identification, and whole genome functional\\ninterpretation and analysis. The techniques developed for analyzing genomic and other types of\\nscientific data can be expected to to play a role on analyzing a broad range of biological data.\\nDistributed Data Mining.Traditionally, data mining has required that the relevant data be warehoused in\\na single location. Recently, distributed data mining systems have exploited wide area, high performance\\nnext networks, such as the NSF vBNS network, to mine large amounts of distributed scientific and\\nhealth care data. Recently, these systems have set records for the sustained movement of very large\\namounts of data over wide area networks. Separately, a prototype has been developed exploiting\\ndistributed data mining to improve the detection of credit card fraud.\\nText Mining. Recently, data mining has been combined with algorithms from information retrieval to\\nimprove the precision and recall of queries on very large collections of documents. In particular, some\\nof these algorithms have proved useful on multi-lingual collections and others have shown their worth\\non querying using concepts instead of key words.\\n6. Trends that Effect Data Mining\\nIn this section, we describe five external trends which promise to have a fundamental impact on data\\nmining.\\nData Trends. Perhaps the most fundamental external trend is the explosion of digital data during the past\\ntwo decades. During this period, the amount of data probably has grown between six to ten orders of\\nmagnitude. Much of this data is accessible via networks. On the other hand, during this same period the\\nnumber of scientists, engineers, and other analysts available to analyze this data has remained relatively\\nconstant. For example, the number of new Ph.D.’s in statistics graduating each year has remained\\nrelatively constant during this period. Only one conclusion is possible: either most of the data is destined\\nto be write-only, or techniques, such as data mining, must be developed, which can automate, in part, the\\nanalysis of this data, filter irrelevant information, and extract meaningful knowledge.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Hardware Trends. Data mining requires numerically and statistically intensive computations on large\\ndata sets. The increasing memory and processing speed of workstations enables the mining of data sets\\nusing current algorithms and techniques that were too large to be mined just a few years ago. In addition,\\nthe commoditization of high performance computing through SMP workstations and high performance\\nworkstation clusters enables attacking data mining problems that were accessible using only the largest\\nsupercomputers of a few years ago.\\nNetwork Trends. The next generation internet (NGI) will connect sites at OC-3 (155 MBits/sec) speeds\\nand higher. This is over 100 times faster than the connectivity provided by current networks. With this\\ntype of connectivity, it becomes possible to correlate distributed data sets using current algorithms and\\ntechniques. In addition, new protocols, algorithms, and languages are being developed to facilitate\\ndistributed data mining using current and next generation networks.\\nScientific Computing Trends. As mentioned above, scientists and engineers today view simulation as a\\nthird mode of science. Data mining and knowledge discovery serves an important role linking the three\\nmodes of science: theory, experiment and simulation, especially for those cases in which the experiment\\nor simulation results in large data sets.\\nBusiness Trends. Today businesses must be more profitable, react quicker, and offer higher quality\\nservices than ever before, and do it all using fewer people and at lower cost. With these types of\\nexpectations and constraints, data mining becomes a fundamental technology, enabling businesses to\\nmore accurately predict opportunities and risks generated by their customers and their customers’\\ntransactions.\\n7. Research Challenges\\nIn this section, we describe some of the major research challenges identified by the three workshops.\\nThe research challenges are arranged into five broad areas: A) improving the scalability of data mining\\nalgorithms, B) mining non-vector data, C) mining distributed data, D) improving the ease of use of data\\nmining systems and environments, and E) privacy and security issues for data mining.\\nA. Scaling data mining algorithms. Most data mining algorithms today assume that the data fits into\\nmemory. Although success on large data sets is often claimed, usually this is the result of sampling large\\ndata sets until they fit into memory. A fundamental challenge is to scale data mining algorithms as \\n1. the number of records or observations increases; \\n2. the number of attributes per observation increases; \\n3. the number of predictive models or rule sets used to analyze a collection of observations increases;\\n4. and, as the demand for interactivity and real-time response increases. \\nNot only must distributed, parallel, and out-of-memory versions of current data mining algorithms be\\ndeveloped, but genuinely new algorithms are required. For example, association algorithms today can\\nanalyze out-of-memory data with one or two passes, while requiring only some auxiliary data be kept in\\nmemory. \\nB. Extending data mining algorithms to new data types. Today, most data mining algorithms work with\\nwith vector-valued data. It is an important challenge to extend data mining algorithms to work with\\nother data types, including 1) time series and process data, 2) unstructured data, such as text, 3)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'grossman98-Data-minin-research-opportunities.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='semi-structured data, such as HTML and XML documents, 4) multi-media and collaborative data, 5)\\nhierarchical and multi-scale data, and 6) and collection-valued data. \\nC. Developing distributed data mining algorithms. Today most data mining algorithms require bringing\\nall together data to be mined in a single, centralized data warehouse. A fundamental challenge is to\\ndevelop distributed versions of data mining algorithms so that data mining can be done while leaving\\nsome of the data in place. In addition, appropriate protocols, languages, and network services are\\nrequired for mining distributed data to handle the meta-data and mappings required for mining\\ndistributed data. As wireless and pervasive computing environments become more common, algorithms\\nand systems for mining the data produced by these types of systems must also be developed.\\nD. Ease of Use. Data mining today is at best a semi-automated process and perhaps destined to always\\nremain so. On the other hand, a fundamental challenge is to develop data mining systems which are\\neasier to use, even by casual users. Relevant techniques include improving user interface, supporting\\ncasual browsing and visualization of massive and distributed data sets, developing techniques and\\nsystems to manage the meta-data required for data mining, and developing appropriate languages and\\nprotocols for providing casual access to data. In addition, the development of data mining and\\nknowledge discovery environments which address the process of collecting, processing, mining, and\\nvisualizing data, as well as the collaborative and reporting aspects necessary when working with data\\nand information derived from it, is another important fundamental challenge.\\nE. Privacy and Security. Data mining can be a powerful means of extracting useful information from\\ndata. As more and more digital data becomes available, the potential for misuse of data mining grows. A\\nfundamental challenge is to develop privacy and security models and protocols appropriate for data\\nmining and to ensure that next generation data mining systems are designed from the ground up to\\nemploy these models and protocols.\\n8. Testbeds and Infrastructure\\nExperimental studies will play a critical role in advancing the field of data mining. Developed testbeds\\nfor high performance and distributed data mining is essential for progress in the field. \\nThe requirements for data mining testbeds are different than those for general purpose high performance\\ncomputing testbeds. For example, the computing resources for data mining testbeds are as much\\ndisk-oriented as processor-oriented; the network resources must be able move data sets and data\\nelements between geographically distributed sites with guaranteed quality of service; and a variety of\\ngeneral purpose and specialized data mining software must be available.\\nPerhaps the two most difficult challenges in creating data mining testbeds and national resources in data\\nmining are assembling a) the appropriate data sets and b) the required interdisciplinary and\\nmultidisciplinary teams. \\n9. Findings and Recommendations\\nIn this section, we list some of the major findings of these three workshops.\\nFor all interested parties:'),\n",
