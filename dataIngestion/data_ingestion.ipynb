       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'speech.txt'}, page_content='The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL, TAHZH -\\u2060, Hindi: [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit.\\u2009\\'Crown of the Palace\\') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.\\u20091628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\\n\\nConstruction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).\\n\\nThe building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor\\'s court architect.\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\". It is regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.\\n\\nEtymology\\nThe name \"Taj Mahal\" is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words tāj mahall meaning \"crown\" (tāj) \"palace\" (mahall).[4][5][6] Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[7] The name \"Taj\" might have been derived from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[8][9]\\n\\nInspiration\\n\\nShah Jahan, 17th century painting\\n\\nArtistic depiction of Mumtaz Mahal\\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[10][11] Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.[12][13]\\n\\nThe imperial court documenting Shah Jahan\\'s grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.[14] According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, Shah Jahan did not show the same level of affection for others as he had shown Mumtaz while she was alive. After her death, he avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief and gave up listening to music and lavish dressing for two years. Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. He chose the place for the construction of Mumtaz\\'s tomb after which Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.[15]\\n\\nArchitecture and design\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal complex is situated on a platform on the banks of the Yamuna River.\\nMain article: Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal\\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture.[16] Inspirations for the building came from Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty) and Humayun\\'s Tomb in Delhi which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht plan of the site.[17][18] The building complex employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols.[16] While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time.[19] The entire complex sits on platform measuring 300 metres (980 ft) in length and 8.7 metres (28.5 ft) in height on the banks of Yamuna river. The platform is built with varying patterns of dark and light colored sandstone.[20]\\n\\nExterior\\n\\nThe eight sided main structure with large arched doorways and minarets on a square plinth\\nThe mausoleum building is the central structure of the entire complex. It is a white marble structure standing on a 6-metre (20 ft) high square plinth with sides measuring 95.5 metres (313 ft) in length. The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an eight-sided structure that is approximately 57.3 metres (188 ft) long on each of the four long sides.[21]\\n\\nThe building has four identical sides with iwans (arch-shaped doorways), topped by a large dome and finial. Each side of the iwan is framed with a 33-metre (108 ft) high pishtaq (vaulted archway) with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of archways is replicated on a smaller scale on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical.[22] At the southern side of the platform, facing the garden, there are two flights of stairs on either side which are partly covered and provide the only access from ground level up to the mausoleum building.[20]\\n\\n\\nThe large onion dome topped by a finial\\n\\nFinial, tamga of the Mughal Empire\\nThe predominant feature of the mausoleum is the 23-metre (75 ft) high marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The onion shaped dome sits on a 12-metre (39 ft) high cylindrical drum with an inner diameter of 18.4 metres (60 ft).[23] The dome is slightly asymmetrical and is topped by a 9.6-metre (31 ft) high gilded finial.[16][24] The intermediate zone between the drum and the dome is supplanted by an ornamental moulding with a twisted rope design.[20]\\n\\nThe main dome is surrounded by four smaller domes or chattris placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The smaller domes are supported by columns which stand on the top of the main structure and help bring light to the interior of the building. Tall spires called guldastas extend from edges of walls which serve as decorative elements. The main and the smaller domes are decorated with a design resembling a lotus flower.[20] The domes are topped by decorative finials which uses Persian and Indian design elements.[25] The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century.[20] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif, whose horns point heavenward.[26]\\n\\n\\nCloser view of a minaret\\nFour minarets flank the tomb building, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The four minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, are symmetrically arranged on the corners facing the chamfered corners of the main building. Each minaret is composed of three almost equal parts with balconies at the intersection of the portions. The towers are also surmounted by smaller chattris and incorporate the same design elements as the main dome with a finial.[20] Steps lead to the top of the tower with rectangular openings below the domes providing light and air on the top. The minarets were designed similar to traditional elements of a mosque, which are used by the muezzin to call for prayer. The minarets were constructed slightly oriented towards the outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.[20]\\n\\n\\nSouthern facade showing the great pishtaq, jali windows and calligraphy\\nThe external surfaces of the building are decorated with a number of delicate relief art adorned with various precious and semi-previous stones.[21] The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. The white marble dados consist of ornamental bas relief depictions of nature and plant based elements. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings and the frames and archway spandrels are decorated with pietra dura inlays of stylised geometric pattern of vines, flowers and fruits.[27]\\n\\n\\nPlant motifs on walls\\nThe domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles.[13] Contrasting colors have been used to create a complex array of different geometric patterns across the mortared areas of the buildings. The floors and walkways are laid with tiles or blocks with contrasting colors and consisting of various tessellation patterns. The plinth is differentiated from the paved surface of the main platform by an interlocking pattern of octagonal white marble pieces set into four pointed stars made of red sandstone, surrounded by a border. The building has many lattice windows or jalis with interlocking hexagonal patterns.[20]\\n\\nThe gateway arches are bordered by Arabic calligraphy with passages from the Qur\\'an. Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written with slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below.[27] The calligraphy on the southern gate roughly translates to \"O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.\"[28] The calligraphy on the buildings were believed to have been created in 1609 by Abdul Haq, who was conferred the title of \"Amanat Khan\" by Shah Jahan.[29][27] At the base of the interior dome is the inscription, \"Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi\".[30]\\n\\nInterior\\n\\nThe central chamber with the cenotaphs\\n\\nA jali screen surrounding the cenotaphs\\nThe main inner chamber is an octagon with 7.3-metre (24 ft) sides, with the design allowing for entry from each face with the main door facing the garden to the south. Two tiers of eight pishtaq arches are located along the walls, similar to the exterior.[31] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony\\'s exterior window has an intricate jali. The inner wall is open along the axes where jali screens are fitted which transmit light from the exterior to the interior of the main chamber.[32] Except the south side, other three sides consist of an open elongated room flanked by two square cells covered with decorated ceilings set on the platform. The central room has arched openings on three sides fitted with jalis filled with panes of glass and a small rectangular window cut into the central jali.[32] The square cells which are reached through separate doors were probably originally used for visitors and Qur\\'an reciters as a place to rest. Staircases lead from the ground floor to the roof level, where there are corridors between the central hall and the two corner rooms in the south with a system of ventilation shafts.[20]\\n\\nThe interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are topped by a \"false\" interior dome decorated with a sun motif. The inlay work is a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[33] Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels similar to the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex.[34] The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, while the real ones are in the basement.[22] Perforated marble jalis (mahjar-i mushabbak) border the cenotaphs and are made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones. The cenotaphs were originally covered by a screen made of gold on the occasion of the second anniversary of Mumtaz Mahal\\'s death in 1633, which was later replaced by the marble screen in 1643.[32]\\n\\n\\nThe false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the main chamber\\n\\nThe actual sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal (right) and Shah Jahan (left) in the lower level\\nSituated within the screen in the upper main chamber are the likenesses of the tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan with the actual burials done below in the lower tomb chamber. From the southern main entrance room, a stairway leads to the lower tomb chamber which is rectangular in shape with walls laid with marble and an undecorated coved ceiling.[32] The cenotaph of Mumtaz is located in the exact center of the chamber on a marble base of 1.5 by 2.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 2 in). Shah Jahan\\'s cenotaph is situated on a larger base on the western side in an asymmetrical arrangement. On the top is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box denoting it as a male tomb.[31] The cenotaphs are aligned north–south, with the head towards the north and the bodies were laid in on their sides with the face turned towards the west, facing Mecca.[32]\\n\\n\\nMotifs on the screen\\n\\nFlower decoration\\nThe calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate. While the cenotaphs are similar to the ones from the Mughal era, no other tombs from the era were adorned with such an exquisite decoration.[35] On Mumtaz\\'s sarcophagus on the top, the decoration consists of natural plum fruits, buds and flower blossoms inlaid with Qur\\'anic inscriptions with the epitaph reading \"The illumined grave of Arjumand Bano Begam, entided Mumtaz Mahal, who died in the year 1631\". The original tomb in the lower level is largely undecorated, with Ninety Nine Names of God inscribed on the side.[32] The false cenotaph of Shah Jahan has similar decorations and is covered with flowers and other scroll work without any inscriptions. The epitaph surrounded by red poppy flowers reads \"This is the sacred grave of His Most Exalted Majesty, Dweller in Paradise (Firdaus Ashiyani), Second Lord of the Auspicious. Conjunction (Sahib-i Qiran-i Sani), Shah Jahan, Padshah; may it ever be fragrant! The year 1076 [AD 1666]\".[32] The original cenotaph of Shah Jahan is a more simply decorated version with similar red flowers and yellow plants with a more comprehensive epitaph reading \"This is the illumined grave and sacred resting place of the emperor, dignified as Rizwan, residing in Eternity, His Majesty, having his abode in [the celestial realm of] Illiyun, Dweller in Paradise (Firdaus Ashiyani) [posthumous title of Shah Jahan], the Second Sahib-i Qiran, Shah Jahan, Padshah Ghazi [Warrior for the Faith]; may it be sanctified and may Paradise become his abode. He travelled from this world to the banquet hall of eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year one thousand and seventy-six Hijri [31 January AD 1666]\".[32]\\n\\nGarden\\n\\nWalkways beside the reflecting pool and the gardens\\nThe complex is set around a large 300 m2 (3,200 sq ft) charbagh or Mughal garden. The garden is divided by two main walkways (khiyaban) into four quadrants with further raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. The garden is surrounded by a walkway connecting all the quadrants. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with five fountains and a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad.[36] Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees and fountains.[37] In the north-western quadrant, is a place that marks the site where Mumtaz Mahal was first buried, before her body was moved to its final resting place inside the main chamber of the mausoleum.[38]\\n\\nThe charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor and symbolises the Paradise garden (Jannah) with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east.[39] While most gardens of the era are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre, the Taj gardens is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh (\"Moonlight Garden\") on the other side of the Yamuna river, the Archaeological Survey of India has hypothesised that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden\\'s design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise.[40] Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggest that both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan.[41] Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees.[42] As the Mughal Empire declined, the gardens were not maintained, and when the British Raj assumed management of the gardens, they changed the landscaping to resemble the formal lawns of London in the 19th century.[43][44]\\n\\nThe water supply for the gardens were derived from the Yamuna River, where a water channel transported the water into an underground reservoir along the eastern wall of a storage building containing multiple storage tanks. The water from the reservoir was lifted by means of a system of pulleys and wheels, turned by animals, to a tank that supplied an aqueduct which ran south carrying water up to the western wall before turning east. The water was later distributed throughout the garden through earthenware pipes embedded underground. The fountains in the central tank consisted of large vessels made of copper and inter-connected through copper pipes and the drop from the 9.47 m (31.1 ft) high walls created the necessary water for the fountains.[38]\\n\\nOutlying buildings\\n\\nThe main gateway (darwaza)\\n\\nThe western building, a mosque, faces the tomb\\nThe Taj Mahal complex is enclosed by crenellated red sandstone walls on three sides, with the side facing the Yamuna river left open. Outside the complex walls, there are other mausoleums dedicated to Shah Jahan\\'s other wives, royals and favorite servants. The inner sides of the walls feature columned arcades typical of Hindu temples, adorned with domed cuppola like chattris and smaller structures like the Music House interspersed between them. The main gateway, primarily built of marble, mirrors the tomb\\'s architecture and incorporates intricate decorations like bas-relief and pietra dura inlays. At the far end of the complex stand two similar buildings built of red sandstone, one of which is designated as a mosque and the other as a jawab, a structure to provide architectural symmetry. The mosque\\'s design resembles others built during the era and the jawab has floors with inlaid patterns while lacking a mihrab.[13]\\n\\nConstruction\\nAnimation showing the construction of Taj Mahal\\nThe land on which the Taj Mahal is situated was present to the south of the walled city of Agra which was given to Shah Jahan by Raja Jai Singh I in exchange for a large palace in the centre of Agra.[45] The building was commissioned in 1631, and construction commenced in 1632.[22][13] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with lime and stone to form the footings of the tomb. The platform above the ground was constructed of brick and mortar.[21]\\n\\nThe tomb complex was built mainly using brick and lime mortar. The external surface of the main tomb building and the interior of the main cenotaph chamber is veneered with white marble. The other interior surfaces and other accessory buildings are lined with red sandstone coated with a red octet for protection, excluding the exterior surfaces of domes.[21] The white marble came from Makrana in Rajasthan, while the red sandstone was quarried from Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh. Many precious and semi-precious stones, used for decoration, were imported from across the world, including jade and crystal from China, turquoise from Tibet, Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, sapphire from Sri Lanka and carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.[46][21]\\n\\nIt is believed that more than 20,000 artisans, labourers, painters and others were involved in the construction of the building. Specialist sculptors from Bukhara, calligraphers from Syria and Persia, designers from southern India, stone cutters from Baluchistan and Italian artisans were employed.[13] Workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb rather than wooden scaffolds.[47] A 15 km (9.3 mi) long earthern ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site, hauled on specially constructed wagons by teams of oxen and elephants.[48] An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of an animal-powered devices.[49]\\n\\nWhen the structure was partially completed, the first ceremony was held at the mausoleum by Shah Jahan on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal.[a][50] Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years.[12] The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).[21][51]\\n\\nLater years\\n\\nPhotograph of the Taj Mahal by Samuel Bourne, 1860s\\nIn December 1652, Shah Jahan\\'s son Aurangzeb wrote a letter to his father about the tomb, the mosque and the assembly hall of the complex developing extensive leaks during the previous rainy season.[52] In 1658, Shah Jahan was deposed by Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan\\'s death in 1666, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.[53] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur attacked the Taj Mahal while invading Agra and took away two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which had hung over the main cenotaph and the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.[54]\\n\\nBy the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a restoration project, which was completed in 1908.[55] He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber and replaced the gardens with European-style lawns that are still in place today.[56]\\n\\n\\nProtective wartime scaffolding in 1942\\nIn 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force.[57][58] Since Indian independence in 1947, the Archaeological Survey of India has been responsible for the maintenance of the monument.[59] During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.[60]\\n\\nIn 1983, the Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for being \"the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[1]\\n\\nSince the late 20th century, the monument has been affected by environmental pollution which has turned the Taj Mahal yellow-brown.[61][62] Acid rain and pollution affecting the Yamuna River including the presence of Mathura Oil Refinery, have contributed to the same.[63][64] After directives by the Supreme Court of India, in 1997 the Indian government set up the \"Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)\", a 10,400-square-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.[65][66]\\n\\nConcerns for the tomb\\'s structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin, with cracks appearing in parts of the tomb in 2010 and the minarets surrounding the monument showing signs of tilting.[67] Minor damage was reported due to storms on 11 April 2018 and 31 May 2020.[68][69] In the 2020s, the Government of India has undertaken various restoration measures, including placing mud packs to restore the white color and replacing broken marble.[70][71][72]\\n\\nSymbolism\\nMain article: Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal § Concepts, symbolism and interpretations\\n\\nTaj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India.\\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.[73]\\n\\nAlong with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan\\'s wealth and power, and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule.[74] Bilateral symmetry, dominated by a central axis, has historically been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal.[75] Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north–south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.[76]\\n\\nThe planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal\\'s mansion in the garden of Paradise.[75] The concept of gardens of paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. The structure is decorated with colorful relief and semi-precious stones using a technique called parchin kari, symbolizing grandeur.[77] The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The white marble reflects varying hues—pinkish in the morning, milky white during the day, golden in the moonlight, and sometimes even a bluish hue under certain lighting conditions. This effect is due to the marble\\'s surface reacting to light and moisture, creating a magical and ever-changing visual experience. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.[78]\\n\\nAccording to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan was split into two – one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side, meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.[75]\\n\\nTourism\\n\\nVisitors at the Taj Mahal\\nThe Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts a large number of domestic and foreign visitors. About five million visitors visited Taj Mahal in the financial year 2022–23.[3] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. As of 2024, the fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ₹540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ₹1,100. Visitors are allowed through three gates and as polluting vehicles are not allowed near the complex, tourists must either walk or take electric buses from the designated parking areas. The complex is open on all days except on Friday from one hour before sunrise to 45 minutes before sunset.[79] The complex is open for limited night viewing on the day of the full moon, excluding the month of Ramadan.[80] In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.[81]\\n\\nThe small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers.[82] Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the New Seven Wonders of the World, a poll conducted in 2007.[83] Foreign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India.[84][85][86][87]\\n\\nMyths\\n\\nJean-Baptiste Tavernier, one of the first European writers about the Taj Mahal\\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument.[88] A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river.[10] The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveler and gem merchant, who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh seeming to support the argument were, however, proven false after excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black.[89] A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan\\'s obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[90]\\n\\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberment and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[91][92] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design.[93] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck\\'s biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck\\'s fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[94] Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[95]\\n\\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India\\'s Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak\\'s petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[93][96] In 2005, a similar petition brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher claiming that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu king Paramardi in 1196, was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court.[97] Several court cases and statements by right-wing politicians about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak\\'s 1989 book Taj Mahal: The True Story, in which he claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century.[98][99] In November 2015, the Union Minister of Culture stated in the Indian Parliament that there was no evidence that it was ever a temple.[100] In August 2017, the Archaeological Survey of India declared that there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[101]\\n\\nAnother such unsupported theory, that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879. Keene went by a translation of a Spanish work, Itinerario (The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643). Another theory, that a Frenchman named Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj, was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E. B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[102]')]"

Code is available at https://github.com/RManLuo/\\ngraph-constrained-reasoning.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities in handling complex\\ntasks (Qiao et al., 2023; Huang & Chang, 2023), marking a significant leap that bridges the gap\\nbetween human and machine intelligence. However, LLMs still struggle with conducting faithful\\nreasoning due to issues of lack of knowledge and hallucination (Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al.,\\n2023). These issues result in factual errors and flawed reasoning processes (Nguyen et al., 2024),\\nwhich greatly undermine the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.\\nTo address these issues, many studies utilize knowledge graphs (KGs), which encapsulate extensive\\nfactual information in a structured format, to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs (Pan et al.,\\n2024; Luo et al., 2024). Nevertheless, because of the unstructured nature of LLMs, directly applying\\nthem to reason on KGs is challenging.\\nExisting KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods can be roughly categorized into two groups:\\nretrieval-based and agent-based paradigms, as shown in Figure 2 (a) and (b). Retrieval-based meth-\\nods (Li et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; Dehghan et al., 2024) retrieve relevant facts from KGs\\nwith an external retriever and then feed them into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning. Agent-based\\nmethods (Sun et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024) treat LLMs as agents that iteratively\\ninteract with KGs to find reasoning paths and answers.\\n∗Equal Contribution.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2410.13080v1  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2024\\n67.0%\\n18.0%\\n15.0%\\nFaithful Reasoning Path\\nInvalid - Format Error\\nInvalid - Relation Error\\nFigure\\n1:\\nAnalysis\\nof reasoning errors in\\nRoG (Luo et al., 2024).\\nDespite their success, retrieval-based methods require additional accurate\\nretrievers, which may not generalize well to unseen questions or account\\nfor the graph structure (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024). Conversely, agent-\\nbased methods necessitate multiple rounds of interaction between agents\\nand KGs, leading to high computational costs and latency (Dehghan et al.,\\n2024). Furthermore, existing works still suffer from serious hallucination\\nissues (Agrawal et al., 2024). Sui et al. (2024) indicates that RoG (Luo\\net al., 2024), a leading KG-enhanced reasoning method, still experiences\\n33% hallucination errors during reasoning on KGs, as shown in Figure 1.\\nTo this end, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning (GCR), a novel KG-\\nguided reasoning paradigm that connects unstructured reasoning in LLMs\\nwith structured knowledge in KGs, seeking to eliminate hallucinations dur-\\ning reasoning on KGs and ensure faithful reasoning. Inspired by the con-\\ncept that LLMs reason through decoding (Wei et al., 2022), we incorporate\\nthe KG structure into the LLM decoding process. This enables LLMs to directly reason on graphs\\nby generating reliable reasoning paths grounded in KGs that lead to correct answers.\\nIn GCR, we first convert KG into a structured index, KG-Trie, to facilitate efficient reasoning on KG\\nusing LLM. Trie is also known as the prefix tree (Wikipedia contributors, 2024) that compresses a\\nset of strings, which can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes\\n(De Cao et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022). KG-Trie encodes the reasoning paths in KGs as formatted\\nstrings to constrain the decoding process of LLMs. Then, we propose graph-constrained decoding\\nthat employs a lightweight KG-specialized LLM to generate multiple KG-grounded reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers. With the constraints from KG-Trie, we ensure faithful reasoning while\\nleveraging the strong reasoning capabilities of LLMs to efficiently explore paths on KGs in constant\\ntime. Finally, we input multiple generated reasoning paths and hypothesis answers into a powerful\\ngeneral LLM to utilize its inductive reasoning ability to produce final answers. In this way, GCR\\ncombines the graph reasoning strength of KG-specialized LLMs and the inductive reasoning advan-\\ntage in general LLMs to achieve faithful and accurate reasoning on KGs. The main contributions of\\nthis work are as follows:\\n• We propose a novel framework called graph-constrained reasoning (GCR) that bridges the\\ngap between structured knowledge in KGs and unstructured reasoning in LLMs, allowing\\nfor efficient reasoning on KGs via LLM decoding.\\n• We combine the complementary strengths of a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with a\\npowerful general LLM to enhance reasoning performance by leveraging their respective\\ngraph-based reasoning and inductive reasoning capabilities.\\n• We conduct extensive experiments on several KGQA reasoning benchmarks, demonstrat-\\ning that GCR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero hallucination, but\\nalso shows zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen KGs without additional train-\\ning.\\n2\\nRELATED WORK\\nLLM reasoning. Many studies have been proposed to analyze and improve the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs (Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024). To elicit the reasoning ability\\nof LLMs, Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) prompts the model to generate a\\nchain of reasoning steps in response to a question. Wang et al. (2024) propose a self-consistency\\nmechanism that generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer across\\nthem. The tree-of-thought (Yao et al., 2024) structures reasoning as a branching process, exploring\\nmultiple steps in a tree-like structure to find optimal solutions. Other studies focus on fine-tuning\\nLLMs on various reasoning tasks to improve reasoning abilities (Yu et al., 2022; Hoffman et al.,\\n2024). For instance, OpenAI (2024c) adopts reinforcement learning to train their most advanced\\nLLMs called “OpenAI o1” to perform complex reasoning, which produces a long internal chain of\\nthought before final answers.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning. To mitigate the knowledge gap and hallucination issues in LLM\\nreasoning, research incorporates KGs to enhance LLM reasoning (Pan et al., 2024).

To capture graph structure, GNN-\\nRAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to effectively re-\\ntrieve from KGs. Instead of retrieving, StructGPT (Jiang et al., 2023) and ToG (Sun et al., 2024)\\ntreat LLMs as agents to interact with KGs to find reasoning paths leading to the correct answers.\\n3\\nPRELIMINARY\\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) represent a wealth of factual knowledge as a collection of triples: G =\\n{(e, r, e′) ∈E × R × E}, where E and R denote the set of entities and relations, respectively.\\nReasoning Paths are sequences of consecutive triples in KGs: wz = e0\\nr1\\n−→e1\\nr2\\n−→. . .\\nrl\\n−→el,\\nwhere ∀(ei−1, ri, ei) ∈G. The paths reveal the connections between knowledge that potentially\\nfacilitate reasoning. For example, the reasoning path: wz = Alice\\nmarry to\\n−−−−−−→Bob\\nfather of\\n−−−−−−→\\nCharlie indicates that “Alice” is married to “Bob” and “Bob” is the father of “Charlie”. Therefore,\\n“Alice” could be reasoned to be the mother of “Charlie”.\\nKnowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a representative reasoning task with the as-\\nsistance of KGs. Given a natural language question q and a KG G, the task aims to design a function\\nf to reason answers a ∈A based on knowledge from G, i.e., a = f(q, G).\\n3\\n4\\nAPPROACH\\n4.1\\nFROM CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING TO GRAPH-CONSTRAINED REASONING\\nChain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) has been widely adopted to enhance the\\nreasoning ability of LLMs by autoregressively generating a series of reasoning steps leading to the\\nanswer. Specifically, given a question q, CoT models the joint probability of the answer a and\\nreasoning steps z as\\nP(a|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|z, q)Pθ(z|q) =\\nX\\nz\\nPθ(a|q, z)\\n|z|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPθ(zi|q, z1:i−1),\\n(1)\\nwhere q denotes the input question, a denotes the final answer, θ denotes the parameters of LLMs,\\nand zi denotes the i-th step of the reasoning process z. To further enhance the reasoning ability,\\nmany previous works focus on improving the reasoning process Pθ(z|q) by exploring and aggregat-\\ning multiple reasoning processes (Wang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024).\\nDespite the effectiveness, a major issue remains the faithfulness of the reasoning process generated\\nby LLMs (Huang et al., 2024). The reasoning is represented as a sequence of tokens decoded\\nstep-by-step, which can accumulate errors and result in hallucinated reasoning paths and answers\\n(Nguyen et al., 2024). To address these issues, we utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) to guide LLMs\\ntoward faithful reasoning.\\nKG-enhanced Reasoning utilizes the structured knowledge in KGs to improve the reasoning of\\nLLMs (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), which can generally be expressed as finding a reasoning\\npath wz on KGs that connects the entities mentioned in the question and the answer. This can be\\nformulated as\\nP(a|q, G) =\\nX\\nwz\\nPϕ(a|q, wz)Pϕ(wz|q, G),\\n(2)\\nwhere Pϕ(wz|q, G) denotes the probability of discovering a reasoning path wz on KGs G given the\\nquestion q by a function parameterized by ϕ. To acquire reasoning paths for reasoning, most prior\\nstudies follow the retrieval-based (Li et al., 2023) or agent-based paradigm (Sun et al., 2024), as\\nshown in Figure 2 (a) and (b), respectively. Nevertheless, retrieval-based methods rely on precise\\nadditional retrievers, while agent-based methods are computationally intensive and lead to high\\nlatency. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph-constrained reasoning paradigm (GCR).\\nGraph-constrained Reasoning (GCR) directly incorporates KGs into the decoding process of\\nLLMs to achieve faithful reasoning. The overall framework of GCR is illustrated in Figure 2 (c),\\nwhich consists of three main components: 1) Knowledge Graph Trie Construction: building a\\nstructural index of KG to guide LLM reasoning, 2) Graph-constrained Decoding: generating KG-\\ngrounded paths and hypothesis answers using LLMs, and 3) Graph Inductive Reasoning: reasoning\\nover multiple paths and hypotheses to derive final answers.\\n4.2\\nKNOWLEDGE GRAPH TRIE CONSTRUCTION\\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) store abundant knowledge in a structured format. However, large language\\nmodels (LLMs) struggle to efficiently access and reason on KGs due to their unstructured nature. To\\naddress this issue, we propose to convert KGs into knowledge graph Tries (KG-Tries), which serve\\nas a structured index of KGs to facilitate efficient reasoning on graphs using LLMs.\\nA Trie (a.k.a. prefix tree) (Wikipedia contributors, 2024; Fredkin, 1960) is a tree-like data structure\\nthat stores a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a common prefix of its children.\\nTries can be used to restrict LLM output tokens to those starting with valid prefixes (De Cao et al.,\\n2022; Xie et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). The tree structure of Trie is an ideal choice for encoding\\nthe reasoning paths in KGs for LLMs to efficiently traverse.\\nWe first adopt the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to retrieve reasoning paths Wz within L hops\\nstarting from entities mentioned in the questions. The retrieved paths are formatted as sentences\\nusing the template shown in Figure 7. The formatted sentences are then split into tokens by the\\n4\\ntokenizer of LLM and stored as a KG-Trie CG. The overall process can be formulated as:\\nWz = BFS(G, {eq}, L),\\n(3)\\nTz = Tokenizer(Wz),\\n(4)\\nCG = Trie(Tz),\\n(5)\\nwhere eq denotes the entities mentioned in the question, L denotes the maximum hops of paths, and\\nTz denotes the tokens of reasoning paths. The KG-Trie CG is used as a constraint to guide the LLM\\ndecoding process.\\nBy constructing KG-Trie for each question entity, we can enable efficient traversal of reasoning paths\\nin constant time (O(|Wz|)) without costly graph traversal (Sun et al., 2024). Moreover, KG-Trie can\\nbe pre-constructed offline and loaded during reasoning. This significantly reduces the computational\\ncost and latency of reasoning on KGs, making it feasible for real-time applications.\\n============================= Prompt Input ================================\\nPlease generate some reasoning paths in the KG starting from the topic entities to answer the question.\\n# Question: what is the name of justin bieber brother?\\n============================= LLM Output ================================\\n# Reasoning Path: <PATH> Justin Bieber →people.person.parents →Jeremy Bieber →peo-\\nple.person.children →Jaxon Bieber </PATH>\\n# Answer: Jaxon Bieber\\nFigure 3: An example of the graph-constrained decoding. Detailed prompts can be found in Figure 8.\\n4.3\\nGRAPH-CONSTRAINED DECODING\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have strong reasoning capabilities but still suffer from severe hal-\\nlucination issues, which undermines the trustworthiness of the reasoning process. To tackle this\\nissue, we propose graph-constrained decoding, which unifies the reasoning ability of LLMs with the\\nstructured knowledge in KGs to generate faithful KG-grounded reasoning paths leading to answers.\\nGiven a question q, we design an instruction prompt to harness the reasoning ability of LLMs to\\ngenerate reasoning paths wz and hypothesis answers a. To eliminate the hallucination during rea-\\nsoning on KGs, we adopt the KG-Trie CG as constraints to guide the decoding process of LLMs and\\nonly generate reasoning paths that are valid in KGs, formulated as:\\nPϕ(a, wz|q) = Pϕ(a|q, wz)\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRegular decoding\\nGraph-constrained decoding\\nz\\n}|\\n{\\n|wz|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(wzi|q, wz1:i−1)CG(wzi|wz1:i−1),\\n(6)\\nCG(wzi|wz1:i−1) =\\n\\x1a1, ∃prefix(wz1:i, wz), ∃wz ∈Wz,\\n0, else,\\n(7)\\nwhere wzi denotes the i-th token of the reasoning path wz, Pϕ denotes the token probabilities\\npredicted by the LLM with parameters ϕ, and CG(wzi|wz1:i−1) denotes the constraint function that\\nchecks whether the generated tokens wz1:i is a valid prefix of the reasoning path using KG-Trie.\\nAfter a valid reasoning path is generated, we switch back to the regular decoding process to generate\\na hypothesis answer conditioned on the path.\\nTo further enhance KG reasoning ability, we fine-tune a lightweight KG-specialized LLM with\\nparameters ϕ on the graph-constrained decoding task. Specifically, given a question q, the LLM is\\noptimized to generate relevant reasoning paths wz that are helpful for answering the question, then\\nprovide a hypothesis answer a based on it, which can be formulated as:\\nL = E(q,wz,a)∼DG log Pϕ(a, wz|q) = E\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f0log\\n|a|\\nY\\ni=1\\nPϕ(ai|q, wz, a1:i−1)\\n|wz|\\nY\\nj=1\\nPϕ(wzj|q, wz1:j−1)\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fb,\\n(8)\\nwhere ai and wzj denote the i-th token of the answer a and the j-th token of the reasoning path wz,\\nrespectively.\\n5\\nThe training data (q, wz, a) ∈DG consists of question-answer pairs and reasoning paths generated\\nfrom KGs. We use the shortest paths connecting the entities in the question and answer as the\\nreasoning path wz for training, where details can be found in Section 7. An example of graph-\\nconstrained decoding is illustrated in Figure 3, where <PATH> and </PATH> are special tokens\\nto control the start and end of graph-constrained decoding. Experiment results in Section 5.2 show\\nthat even a lightweight KG-specialized LLM (0.5B) can achieve satisfactory performance in KG\\nreasoning.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding method differs from retrieval-based methods by integrating a pre-\\nconstructed KG-Trie into the decoding process of LLMs. This not only reduces input tokens, but\\nalso bridges the gap between unstructured reasoning in LLMs and structured knowledge in KGs,\\nallowing for efficient reasoning on KGs regardless of its scale, which results in faithful reasoning\\nleading to answers. Additionally, experimental results in Section 5.4 demonstrate that KG-Trie can\\nintegrate with new KGs on the fly, showcasing its zero-shot generalizability for reasoning on unseen\\nKGs without further training.\\n4.4\\nGRAPH INDUCTIVE REASONING\\nGraph-constrained decoding harnesses the reasoning ability of a KG-specialized LLM to generate a\\nfaithful reasoning path and a hypothesis answer. However, complex reasoning tasks typically admit\\nmultiple reasoning paths that lead to correct answers (Stanovich et al., 2000). Incorporating diverse\\nreasoning paths would be beneficial for deliberate thinking and reasoning (Evans, 2010; Wang et al.,\\n2024). To this end, we propose to input multiple reasoning paths and hypothesis answers generated\\nby the KG-specialized LLM into a powerful general LLM to leverage its inductive reasoning ability\\nto produce final answers.\\nThe graph-constrained decoding seamlessly integrates into the decoding process of LLMs, allowing\\nit to be paired with various LLM generation strategies like beam-search (Federico et al., 1995) to\\ntake advantage of the GPU parallel computation. Thus, given a question, we adopt graph-constrained\\ndecoding to simultaneously generate K reasoning paths and hypothesis answers with beam search in\\na single LLM call, which are then inputted into a general LLM to derive final answers. The overall\\nprocess can be formulated as:\\nZK = {ak, wk\\nz}K\\nk=1 = arg top-K Pϕ(a, wz|q),\\n(9)\\nPθ(A|q, ZK) ≃\\nK\\nY\\nk=1\\nPθ(A|q, ak, wk\\nz),\\n(10)\\nwhere θ denotes the parameters of the general LLM, ZK denotes the set of top-K reasoning paths\\nand hypothesis answers, and A denotes the final answers.\\nWe follow the FiD framework (Izacard & Grave, 2021; Singh et al., 2021) to incorporate multiple\\nreasoning paths and hypothesis answers to conduct inductive reasoning within one LLM call, i.e.,\\nPθ(A|q, ZK), where detailed prompts can be found in Figure 9. The general LLM can be any\\npowerful LLM, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), or Llama-3 (Meta, 2024), which can effectively\\nleverage their internal reasoning ability to reason over multiple reasoning paths to produce final\\nanswers without additional fine-tuning.\\n5\\nEXPERIMENT\\nIn our experiments, we aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1: Can GCR achieve\\nstate-of-the-art reasoning performance with balances between efficiency and effectiveness? RQ2:\\nCan GCR eliminate hallucinations and conduct faithful reasoning? RQ3: Can GCR generalize to\\nunseen KGs on the fly?\\n5.1\\nEXPERIMENT SETUPS\\nDatasets. Following previous research (Luo et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024), we first evaluate the\\nreasoning ability of GCR on two benchmark KGQA datasets: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al.,\\n2016) and Complex WebQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018).

To further evaluate the generalizability\\nof GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer experiments on two new KGQA datasets: CommonsenseQA\\n(CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE (MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). For CSQA, we use\\nConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) as the KG, while for MedQA, we use a medical KG constructed\\nfrom the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The details of the datasets are\\ndescribed in Section 7.\\nBaselines. We compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning\\nmethods, 2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The detailed\\nbaselines are listed in Section 8.\\nEvaluation Metrics. We adopt Hit and F1 as the evaluation metrics following previous works (Luo\\net al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024) on WebQSP and CWQ. Hit checks whether any correct answer exists in\\nthe generated predictions, while F1 considers the coverage of all answers by balancing the precision\\nand recall of predictions. Because CSQA and MedQA are multiple-choice QA datasets, we adopt\\naccuracy as the evaluation metric.\\nImplementations. For GCR, we use the KG-Trie to index all the reasoning paths within 2 hops\\nstarting from question entities. For the LLMs, we use a fine-tuned Llama-3-8B (Meta, 2024) as\\nthe KG-specialized LLM. We generate top-10 reasoning paths and hypothesis answers from graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We adopt the advanced ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI,\\n2024a) as the general LLMs for inductive reasoning. The detailed hyperparameters and experiment\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\n5.2\\nRQ1: REASONING PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY\\nMain Results. In this section, we compare GCR with other baselines on KGQA benchmarks to\\nevaluate the reasoning performance. From the results shown in Table 1, GCR achieves the best\\nperformance on both datasets, outperforming the second-best by 2.1% and 9.1% in terms of Hit on\\nWebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The results demonstrate that GCR can effectively leverage KGs to\\nenhance LLMs and achieve state-of-the-art reasoning performance.\\nAmong the LLM reasoning methods, ChatGPT with self-consistency prompts demonstrates the best\\nperformance, which indicates the powerful reasoning ability inherent in LLMs. However, their per-\\nformances are still limited by the model size and complex reasoning required over structured data.\\nGraph reasoning methods, such as ReaRev, achieve competitive performance on WebQSP by ex-\\n7\\nTable 2: Efficiency and performance comparison of different methods on WebQSP.\\nTypes\\nMethods\\nHit\\nAvg.

But they struggle to generalize across different datasets and\\nunderperform on CWQ. In KG+LLM methods, both agent-based methods (e.g., ToG, EffiQA) and\\nretrieval-based methods (e.g., RoG, GNN-RAG) achieve the second-best performance. Neverthe-\\nless, they still suffer from inefficiency and reasoning hallucinations which limit their performance.\\nIn contrast, GCR effectively eliminates hallucinations and conducts faithful reasoning by leveraging\\nthe structured KG index and graph-constrained decoding.\\nEfficiency Analysis.\\nTo show the efficiency of GCR, we compare the average runtime, number of LLM calls, and num-\\nber of input tokens with retrieval-based and agent-based methods in Table 2. For retrieval-based\\nmethods, we compare with dense retrievers (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE (Zhang\\net al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)) and graph-based retrievers (e.g., GNN-RAG (Mavro-\\nmatis & Karypis, 2024), RoG (Luo et al., 2024)), which retrieve reasoning paths from KGs and feed\\nthem into LLMs for reasoning answers. For agent-based methods, we compare with ToG (Sun et al.,\\n2024) and EffiQA1 (Dong et al., 2024), which heuristically search on KGs for answers. The detailed\\nsettings are described in Section 9.\\nDense retrievers are most efficient in terms of runtime and LLM calls as they convert all paths into\\nsentences and encode them as embeddings in advance. However, they sacrifice their accuracy in\\nretrieving as they are not designed to encode graph structure. Graph-based retrievers and agent-\\nbased methods achieve better performance by considering graph structure; however, they require\\nmore time and LLM calls. Specifically, the retrieved graph is fed as inputs to LLMs, which leads to\\na large number of input tokens. Agent-based methods, like ToG, require more LLM calls and input\\ntokens as the question difficulty increases due to their iterative reasoning process. In contrast, GCR\\nachieves the best performance with a reasonable runtime and number of LLM calls. With the help\\nof KG-Trie, GCR explores multiple reasoning paths at the same time during the graph-constrained\\ndecoding, which does not involve additional LLM calls or input tokens and benefits from the parallel\\nGPU computation with low latency. More efficiency analysis under different beam sizes used for\\ngraph-constrained decoding can be found in parameter analysis.\\nTable 3: Ablation studies of GCR on two KGQA datasets.\\nVariants\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nF1\\nPrecision\\nRecall\\nGCR (Llama-3.1-8B + ChatGPT)\\n73.2\\n80.0\\n76.9\\n60.9\\n61.1\\n66.6\\nGCR w/o KG-specialized LLM\\n52.9\\n66.3\\n50.2\\n37.5\\n40.8\\n37.9\\nGCR w/o General LLM\\n57.0\\n58.0\\n70.1\\n39.4\\n32.8\\n64.3\\nAblation Study. We first conduct an\\nablation study to analyze the effec-\\ntiveness of the KG-specialized LLM\\nand general LLM in GCR. As shown\\nin Table 3, the full GCR achieves the\\nbest performance on both datasets.\\nBy removing the KG-specialized LLM, we feed all 2-hop reasoning paths into the general LLM.\\nThis results in a significant performance drop, indicating its importance in utilizing reasoning abil-\\nity to find relevant paths on KGs for reasoning. On the other hand, removing the general LLM\\nand relying solely on answers predicted by KG-specialized LLM leads to a noticeable decrease in\\nprecision, due to noises in its predictions. This highlighting the necessity of the general LLM for\\nconducting inductive reasoning over multiple paths to derive final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We further analyze LLMs used for KG-specialized and general LLMs in Table 4.\\nFor KG-specialized LLMs, we directly plug the KG-Trie into different LLMs to conduct graph-\\nconstrained decoding and use the same general LLM for final reasoning. For general LLMs, we\\nadopt the same reasoning paths generated by KG-specialized LLMs to different LLMs to produce\\nfinal answers. For zero-shot and few-shot learning, we adopt the original LLMs without fine-tuning,\\nwhose prompt templates can be found in Figures 8 and 10.\\n1Since there is no available code for EffiQA, we directly copy the results from the original paper.\\n8\\nTable 4: Comparison of different LLMs used in\\nGCR on WebQSP.\\nComponents\\nLearning Types\\nVariants\\nHit\\nF1\\nKG-specialized\\nLLM\\nZero-shot\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n28.25\\n10.32\\nLlama-3.1-70B\\n38.53\\n12.53\\nFew-shot\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n33.24\\n11.19\\nLlama-3.1-70B\\n41.13\\n13.14\\nFine-tuned\\nQwen2-0.5B\\n87.48\\n60.03\\nQwen2-1.5B\\n89.21\\n62.97\\nQwen2-7B\\n92.31\\n72.74\\nLlama-2-7B\\n92.55\\n73.23\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n92.74\\n73.14\\nGeneral LLM\\nZero-shot\\nQwen-2-7B\\n86.32\\n67.59\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n90.24\\n71.19\\nLlama-3.1-70B\\n90.24\\n71.19\\nChatGPT\\n92.55\\n73.23\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n92.23\\n74.05\\nResults in Table 4 show that a lightweight LLM\\n(0.5B) can outperform a large one (70B) af-\\nter fine-tuning, indicating the effectiveness of\\nfine-tuning in enhancing the ability of LLMs\\nand make them specialized for KG reason-\\ning.\\nHowever, the larger LLMs (e.g., 7B\\nand 8B) still perform better than smaller ones,\\nhighlighting the importance of model capac-\\nity in searching relevant reasoning paths on\\nKGs.\\nSimilar trends are observed in gen-\\neral LLMs where larger models (e.g., GPT-4o-\\nmini and ChatGPT) outperform smaller ones\\n(e.g., Qwen-2-7B and Llama-3.1-8B), show-\\ncasing their stronger inductive reasoning abili-\\nties.

We first analyze the impact of dif-\\nferent beam sizes K for graph-constrained decoding on\\nthe performance of GCR. We conduct the experiments on\\nWebQSP with different beam sizes of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 4. We observe that the hit\\nand recall of GCR increase with the beam size. Because,\\nwith a larger beam size, the LLMs can explore more rea-\\nsoning paths and find the correct answers. However, the\\nF1 score, peaks when the beam size is set to 10. This is\\nbecause the beam size of 10 can provide a balance be-\\ntween the exploration and exploitation of the reasoning\\npaths. When the beam size is set to 20, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the search space,\\nwhich may introduce noise and make the reasoning less\\nreliable. This also highlights the importance of using general LLMs to conduct inductive reason-\\ning over multiple paths to disregard the noise and find the correct answers. Although the graph-\\nconstrained decoding benefits from the parallel GPU computation to explore multiple reasoning\\npaths at the same time, the time cost still slightly increases from 1.4s to 7.8s with the increase of\\nthe beam size. Thus, we set the beam size to 10 in the experiments to balance the performance and\\nefficiency. We also investigate the impact of L hops paths used for KG-Trie construction in Sec-\\ntion 10.1. The results show that GCR can achieve a good balance between reasoning performance\\nand efficiency by setting L = 2 and K = 10.\\n5.3\\nRQ2: HALLUCINATION ELIMINATION AND FAITHFUL REASONING\\nIn this section, we investigate the effectiveness of KG constraints in eliminating hallucinations and\\nensuring faithful reasoning. We first compare the difference of answer accuracy (Hit) and faithful\\nreasoning ratio by removing KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding. The faithful reasoning\\nratio is calculated as the percentage of faithful reasoning in correctly predicted answers. We define\\na reasoning as faithful where the generated reasoning path can be found in KGs, and vice versa.\\nGCR GCR w/o constraint\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAnswer Hit\\n100.0%\\n62.4%\\nWebQSP\\nFaithful Reasoning\\nError Reasoning\\nGCR GCR w/o constraint\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAnswer Hit\\n100.0%\\n48.1%\\nCWQ\\nFigure 5: Analysis of performance and reasoning\\nerrors in GCR.\\nFrom the Figure 5, we can observe that GCR\\nachieves the 100% faithful reasoning ratio on\\nboth datasets, which indicates that GCR can\\neliminate hallucinations and ensure faithful rea-\\nsoning during reasoning on KGs. In contrast,\\nwhen removing KG constraints, both the an-\\nswer accuracy and faithful reasoning decrease\\nsignificantly on WebQSP. This shows that KG\\nconstraints not only improve reasoning by re-\\nducing the searching space, but also play a cru-\\ncial role in preventing hallucinations for accu-\\n9\\nTable 5: Examples of the faithful reasoning conducted by GCR.

While the answer hit rate on CWQ remains almost unchanged, the ratio of faithful\\nreasoning still decreases to 48.1%. This implies that even if LLMs can produce correct answers, the\\nreasoning process is still prone to hallucinations and cannot be trusted, which is aligned with the\\nfindings in previous studies (Nguyen et al., 2024).\\nCase Study. We further provide a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of GCR in eliminating\\nhallucinations and ensuring faithful reasoning. As shown in Table 5, the first case demonstrates that,\\nwithout constraints, the model generates an incorrect reasoning path leading to an incorrect answer\\nby hallucinating facts such as “Mabel Rose Ferguson is the child of Naill Ferguson and her parent\\nis Alyssa Mastromonaco”. In contrast, GCR generates a faithful reasoning path grounded in KGs\\nthat “Naill Ferguson has a child named Thomas Ferguson who has a parent named Ayaan Hirsi Ali”.\\nBased on the paths we can reason the correct answer to the question is “Ayaan Hirsi Ali”. In the\\nsecond case, although the LLM answers the question correctly, the generated reasoning path is still\\nhallucinated with incorrect facts. Conversely, GCR conducts faithful reasoning with both correct\\nanswer and reasoning path. These results demonstrate that GCR can effectively eliminate hallucina-\\ntions and ensure faithful reasoning by leveraging KG constraints in graph-constrained decoding.\\n5.4\\nRQ3: ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZABILITY TO UNSEEN KGS\\nTable 6: Zero-shot transferabil-\\nity to other KGQA datasets.\\nModel\\nCSQA\\nMedQA\\nChatGPT\\n79\\n64\\nGCR (ChatGPT)\\n85\\n66\\nGPT-4o-mini\\n91\\n75\\nGCR (GPT-4o-mini)\\n94\\n79\\nIn GCR, the knowledge graph is converted into a constraint which\\nis plugged into the decoding process of LLMs. This allows GCR\\nto generalize to unseen KGs without further training. To evaluate\\nthe generalizability of GCR, we conduct zero-shot transfer ex-\\nperiments on two unseen KGQA datasets: CSQA (Talmor et al.,\\n2019) and MedQA (Jin et al., 2021). Specifically, we use the\\nsame KG-specialized LLM (Llama-3.1-8B) trained on Freebase\\nas well as two general LLMs (ChatGP, GPT-4o-mini). During\\nreasoning, we directly plug the KG-Trie constructed from ConceptNet and medical KGs into the\\nGCR to conduct graph-constrained decoding without additional fine-tuning. The results are shown\\nin Table 6.\\nFrom the results, it is evident that GCR outperforms ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini in zero-shot per-\\nformance on both datasets. Specifically, GCR shows a 7.6% increase in accuracy on CSQA and a\\n3.1% improvement on MedQA compared to ChatGPT. This highlights the strong zero-shot general-\\nizability of its graph reasoning capabilities to unseen KGs without additional training. However, the\\nimprovement on MedQA is not as significant as that on CSQA. We hypothesize this difference may\\nbe due to LLMs having more common sense knowledge, which aids in reasoning on common sense\\nknowledge graphs effectively. On the other hand, medical KGs are more specialized and require\\ndomain-specific knowledge for reasoning, potentially limiting the generalizability of our method.\\n10\\n6\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel LLM reasoning paradigm called graph-constrained reasoning\\n(GCR) to eliminate hallucination and ensure faithful reasoning by incorporating structured KGs. To\\nbridge the unstructured reasoning in LLMs with the structured knowledge in KGs, we propose a\\nKG-Trie to encode paths in KGs using a trie-based index. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process\\nto guide a KG-specialized LLM to generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs. By impos-\\ning constraints, we can not only eliminate hallucination in reasoning but also reduce the reasoning\\ncomplexity, contributing to more efficient and accurate reasoning. Last, a powerful general LLM is\\nutilized as a complement to inductively reason over multiple reasoning paths to generate the final\\nanswer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCR excels in faithful reasoning and generalizes\\nwell to reason on new KGs without additional fine-tuning.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe would want to express our sincere gratitude to Yuan-Fang Li for his valuable feedback and\\nsuggestions during the preparation of this work.\\nREFERENCES\\nGarima Agrawal, Tharindu Kumarage, Zeyad Alghamdi, and Huan Liu.

To compare the reasoning performance with existing methods, we use two bench-\\nmark KGQA datasets in this study: WebQuestionSP (WebQSP) (Yih et al., 2016) and Complex We-\\nbQuestions (CWQ) (Talmor & Berant, 2018). To ensure fairness, we adopt the same train and test\\nsplits as previous works (Jiang et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2024). Details of the datasets can be found in\\nTable 7.\\nBoth WebQSP and CWQ can be reasoned using Freebase KGs2 (Bollacker et al., 2008). To reduce\\nthe size of the KGs, we use a subgraph of Freebase by extracting all triples that start from question\\nentities within the maximum reasoning hops provided by previous works3 (Luo et al., 2024). The\\nstatistics of the knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9.\\nFine-tuning Datasets. To enhance the KG reasoning ability of LLMs, we construct fine-tuning\\ndatasets by generating reasoning paths from the KGs. Specifically, we adopt the training split of\\nWebQSP and CWQ, which contain 2,826 and 27,639 question-answer pairs, respectively. For each\\nquestion, we find all the shortest reasoning paths on KGs that connect the question entity to the\\nanswer entity. We then convert the reasoning paths into formatted strings and pair them with the\\nquestion-answer pairs with the template shown in Figure 8 to form the fine-tuning datasets. Since\\nthere could be multiple reasoning paths for a question, we generate multiple training instances paired\\nwith different reasoning paths for each question-answer pair. The fine-tuning datasets contain 28,307\\nand 181,602 question-reasoning path-answer triples for WebQSP and CWQ, respectively. The statis-\\ntics of the fine-tuning datasets are shown in Table 8.\\nZero-shot Generalization Datasets.\\nTo evaluate the transferability of GCR, we further select\\ntwo new KGQA datasets4: CommonsenseQA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA-USMLE\\n(MedQA) (Jin et al., 2021). CSQA is a 5-way multiple choice QA dataset that involves reasoning\\nwith commonsense knowledge. MedQA is a 4-way multiple choice QA task that requires biomed-\\nical and clinical knowledge. For CSQA, we use the ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017), which is a\\ngeneral-purpose KG that contains commonsense knowledge. For MedQA, we use a medical KG\\n2https://github.com/microsoft/FastRDFStore\\n3WebQSP: https://huggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-webqsp, CWQ: https://\\nhuggingface.co/datasets/rmanluo/RoG-cwq\\n4https://github.com/michiyasunaga/qagnn\\n15\\nconstructed from the Unified Medical Language System (Yasunaga et al., 2021). The statistics of\\nthe knowledge graphs are shown in Table 9. We respectively select 100 questions from each dataset.\\nFor each question, following previous studies (Feng et al., 2020; Yasunaga et al., 2021), a 2-hop\\nsubgraph is extracted from the KGs to form the zero-shot generalization datasets.\\nTable 7: Statistics of datasets.\\nDataset\\nDataset Statistics\\nStatistics of Answer Numbers\\n#Train\\n#Test\\n#Ans = 1\\n2 ≥#Ans ≤4\\n5 ≥#Ans ≤9\\n#Ans ≥10\\nWebQSP\\n2,826\\n1,628\\n51.2%\\n27.4%\\n8.3%\\n12.1%\\nCWQ\\n27,639\\n3,531\\n70.6%\\n19.4%\\n6%\\n4%\\nTable 8: Statistics of fine-tuning datasets for graph-constrained decoding.\\nTotal\\nWebQSP\\nCWQ\\n209,909\\n28,307\\n181,602\\nTable 9: Statistics of constructed knowledge graphs.\\nKG\\n#Entities\\n#Relations\\n#Triples\\nFreebase\\n2,566,291\\n7,058\\n8,309,195\\nConceptNet\\n799,273\\n17\\n2,151,303\\nMedKG\\n9,958\\n15\\n49,974\\n8\\nBASELINES\\nWe compare GCR with the 22 baselines grouped into three categories: 1) LLM reasoning methods,\\n2) graph reasoning methods, and 3) KG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods. The details of each\\nbaseline are described as follows.\\nLLM reasoning methods only rely on LLMs for reasoning without utilizing external KGs. We\\ninclude both the vanilla LLMs with different sizes and the LLMs with advanced reasoning mecha-\\nnisms. Specifically, we consider the following baselines:\\n• Qwen2-0.5B/1.5B.7B (Yang et al., 2024a) provides a series of pre-trained LLMs with dif-\\nferent sizes, including 0.5B, 1.5B, and 7B parameters.\\n• Llama-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) is a large-scale LLM pre-trained on a diverse range of\\ntasks.\\n• Llama-3.1-8B (Meta, 2024) is the updated version of Llama-2 with more powerful reason-\\ning capabilities.\\n• ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) is a powerful closed-source LLM that could follow instructions\\nto conduct complex tasks.\\n• GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024a) is the new flagship model of OpenAI that could reason\\nacross different modalities and tasks.\\n• Few-shot prompt (Brown et al., 2020) is a few-shot learning method that provides LLMs\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct reasoning.\\n• CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a chain-of-thought reasoning method that prompts LLMs to gen-\\nerate a chain of reasoning steps.\\n• Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2024) generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the\\nmost consistent answer.\\n16\\nGraph reasoning methods focus on reasoning on KGs using graph neural networks (GNNs) (Wu\\net al., 2020) or graph-based reasoning mechanisms. We include the following baselines:\\n• GraftNet (Sun et al., 2018) is a graph-based reasoning method that retrieves relevant sub-\\ngraphs from KGs with entity linking.\\n• NSM (He et al., 2021) utilizes the sequential model to mimic the multi-hop reasoning\\nprocess on KGs.\\n• SR+NSM (Zhang et al., 2022) proposes a relation-path retrieval to retrieve subgraphs for\\nmulti-hop reasoning.\\n• ReaRev (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2022) is a GNN-based method that reasons on KGs by\\nconsidering complex graph information.\\nKG-enhanced LLM reasoning methods incorporate KGs to enhance the reasoning abilities of\\nLLMs which can be further divided into retrieval-based and agent-based paradigms. We include the\\nfollowing baselines:\\nRetrieval-based methods retrieve relevant facts from KGs with an external retriever and then feed\\nthem into the inputs of LLMs for reasoning:\\n• KD-CoT (Wang et al., 2023) retrieves relevant knowledge from KGs to generate faithful\\nreasoning plans for LLMs.\\n• EWEK-QA (Dehghan et al., 2024) enriches the retrieved knowledge by searching from\\nboth KGs and web.\\n• RoG (Luo et al., 2024) proposes a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that retrieves\\nreasoning paths from KGs to guide LLMs conducting faithful reasoning.\\n• GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) adopts a lightweight graph neural network to\\neffectively retrieve from KGs.\\n• GNN-RAG+RA (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) combines the retrieval results of both RoG\\nand GNN-RAG to enhance the reasoning performance.\\nAgent-based methods treat LLMs as agents that iteratively interact with KGs to find reasoning paths\\nand answers:\\n• ToG (Sun et al., 2024) conducts the reasoning on KGs by exploring multiple paths and\\nconcludes the final answer by aggregating the evidence from them.\\n• EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024) proposes an efficient agent-based method to reason on KGs.\\n9\\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND EXPERIMENT SETTINGS\\nIn this section, we will detail the implementation of GCR as well as the experiment settings.\\nFine-tuning KG-specialized LLMs. We fine-tune several lightweight LLMs ranging from 0.5B to\\n8B (Yang et al., 2024a; Touvron et al., 2023; Meta, 2024) on the fine-tuning datasets for 3 epochs.\\nThe batch size is set to 4 and the learning rate is set to 2e-5. We use the cosine learning rate scheduler\\npolicy with the warmup ratio set to 0.03. The training is conducted on 2 A100-80G GPUs for each\\nmodel. The training time and memory usage are shown in Table 10.\\nKGQA Experiment Settings. The KGQA experiment shown in Table 1 aims to compare the rea-\\nsoning performance of GCR with existing methods. For our method, we use the fine-tuned Llama-\\n3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs, the general LLM is selected as ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini. The\\nKG-Trie is constructed from the subgraph of Freebase KGs. The maximum reasoning hops are set\\nto 2 for both WebQSP and CWQ. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For\\nvanilla LLMs baselines, we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the questions.\\nFor other baselines, we strictly check whether the original papers follow the same settings and copy\\nthe results for fair comparison.\\nEfficiency Analysis Settings. The efficiency analysis shown in Table 2 aims to compare the effi-\\nciency and performance of different methods on WebQSP. For GCR, we use the same settings as the\\n17\\nTable 10: Training time and memory usage for different KG-specialized LLMs.\\nModel\\nTime\\nMem. Usage per GPU\\nQwen2-0.5B\\n3.47h\\n10G\\nQwen2-1.5B\\n4.11h\\n25G\\nQwen2-7B\\n14.37h\\n81G\\nLlama-2-7B\\n13.93h\\n80G\\nLlama-3.1-8B\\n14.52h\\n85G\\nKGQA experiment. For dense retriever methods (e.g., S-Bert (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), BGE\\n(Zhang et al., 2023), OpenAI-Emb. (OpenAI, 2024b)), we first search all paths within 2-hops on the\\nKGs which are formatted as sentences with the template in Figure 7. Then, we adopt the embedding\\nmodel to encode the path sentences as embeddings which are stored in a vector database. During in-\\nference, we retrieve 10 paths from the vector database with the question as query and feed them into\\nthe LLMs for reasoning. For GNN-RAG (Mavromatis & Karypis, 2024) and RoG (Luo et al., 2024),\\nwe strictly follow the original papers to retrieve reasoning paths and conduct the experiments. For\\nagent-based methods (e.g., ToG (Sun et al., 2024)), we use the same settings detailed in the original\\npapers. For EffiQA (Jiang et al., 2024), since there is no available code, we directly copy the results\\nfrom the original paper.\\nThe average runtime is measured by the time taken to answer the questions. The average number\\nof LLM calls is the number of times the LLMs are called to answer the questions. The average\\nnumber of LLM tokens is the number of tokens inputted into LLMs to answer the questions, such\\nas questions and retrieved reasoning paths. The experiments are conducted on a single A100-80G\\nGPU for each method.\\nAblation Study. In ablation study, we first try to analyze the effectiveness of different components in\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP and CWQ datasets. By removing the KG-specialized\\nLLM (w/o KG-specialized LLM), we search all the 2-hop paths starting from question entities and\\nfeed them into the general LLMs for reasoning. By removing the general LLM (w/o general LLM),\\nwe directly use the hypothesis answers generated by the KG-specialized LLMs as the final answers.\\nDifferent LLMs. We also analyze the different LLMs used for KG-specialized LLMs and general\\nLLMs on WebQSP. For KG-specialized LLMs, we first use the vanilla LLMs with different learning\\ntypes (i.e., zero-shot and few-shot prompting). For zero-shot prompting, we directly ask the models\\nto generate the reasoning paths with the constraints. For few-shot prompting, we provide the models\\nwith a few examples in the prompts to conduct path generation. Detailed prompts can be found in\\nFigures 8 and 10. Then, we fine-tune the lightweight LLMs with different sizes (0.5B to 8B) on the\\ngraph-constrained decoding task. For general LLMs, we use the vanilla LLMs to directly conduct\\nreasoning over multiple reasoning paths. The detailed reasoning prompts can be found in Figure 9.\\nParameter Analysis. We first analyze the performance of GCR with different beam sizes for graph-\\nconstrained decoding. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with beam sizes of 1, 3,\\n5, 10, and 20. Then, we analyze the performance of GCR with different hops of paths encoded in the\\nKG-Trie. We conduct the experiments on the WebQSP datasets with maximum paths hops ranging\\nfrom 1 to 4.\\nFaithful Reasoning Analysis. We investigate the effect of the KG constraints on ensuring faithful\\nreasoning. We adopt the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized LLMs. Then, we compare\\nthe faithful reasoning rate and answer hit of GCR with and without the KG constraints in graph-\\nconstrained decoding. The faithful reasoning rate is the percentage of the faithful reasoning in the\\ncorrectly predicted answers. A reasoning path is considered faithful if it can be found in the KGs,\\nand vice versa. The answer hit is the percentage of the correct answers in the predictions.\\nZero-shot Generalization Analysis. We evaluate the transferability of GCR on two zero-shot gen-\\neralization datasets: CSQA and MedQA. We use the fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B as KG-specialized\\nLLMs and ChatGPT as well as GPT-4o-mini as the general LLMs. The KG-Trie is constructed\\nfrom the subgraph of ConceptNet and MedKG. The maximum reasoning hops are set to 2 for both\\ndatasets. The beam size is set to 10 for graph-constrained decoding. For vanilla LLMs baselines\\n18\\n(i.e., ChatGPT and GPT-4o-mini), we use the zero-shot prompting to ask the models to answer the\\nquestions.\\n10\\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS\\n10.1\\nPERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT HOPS\\nIn this section, we analyze the impact of different hops of reasoning paths on the performance of\\nGCR. We conduct the experiments on WebQSP with different maximum hops of reasoning paths\\nencoded in the KG-Trie. The results are shown in Figure 6. We observe that the performance\\nof GCR increases with the number of hops of reasoning paths. The performance peaks when the\\nmaximum hops of reasoning paths are set to 2. This is because the 2-hop paths can provide sufficient\\ninformation for the LLMs to conduct reasoning. When the hops are set to 3 or 4, the performance\\ndrops due to the increased complexity of the reasoning paths, which may introduce noise and make\\nthe reasoning less reliable. Additionally, the size of the KG-Trie slightly increases from 0.5 MB to\\n7.5 MB with the increase of the hops from 1 to 4. This indicates that the KG-Trie can be efficiently\\nconstructed with a small size and guide the LLMs to reason on graphs effectively.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nKG-Trie Path Length L\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\nAvg.

Scaling up the size of language\\nmodels and conducting diversified prompt meth-\\nods become mainstream (Liu et al., 2023c; Wei\\net al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2023). Given In-context\\nlearning or Chain-of-Thought prompts have already\\nachieved high performance on challenging tasks\\nsuch as commonsense, arithmetic, and symbolic\\nreasoning (Imani et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2021;\\nKojima et al., 2022). Logical reasoning is one of\\nthe most important and long-standing problems in\\nNLP (Hirschberg and Manning, 2015; Russell and\\nNorvig, 2010), and integrating this ability into nat-\\nural language understanding systems has always\\nbeen a goal pursued (Du et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, scaling has been demonstrated\\nto offer limited advantages in resolving complex\\nlogical reasoning issues (Kazemi et al., 2022). For\\nexample, Saparov and He (2022) show that Chain-\\nof-Thought prompting struggles with proof planning\\nfor more complex logical reasoning problems. Addi-\\ntionally, the performance suffers greatly while han-\\ndling recently released and out-of-distribution logi-\\ncal reasoning datasets (Liu et al., 2023a). Despite\\nmany works have explored variants of Chain-of-\\nThought prompts to facilitate LLMs inference (Zelik-\\nman et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), we discover\\nthat the present logical reasoning task prompts\\nplace an excessive amount of emphasis on the\\nreasoning process while ignoring the origin, pur-\\npose, and effectiveness of reasoning (Creswell\\net al., 2022; Xi et al., 2023). As examples shown in\\nQ1: Bob is green. True/false? \\nInput Facts: Alan is blue. Alan is \\nrough. Alan is young. Bob is big. \\nBob is round. Charlie is big. Charlie \\nis blue. Charlie is green. Dave is \\ngreen. Dave is rough.\\nInput Rules: Big people are rough. \\nIf someone is young and round then \\nthey are kind. If someone is round \\nand big then they are blue. All\\nrough people are green.\\nBob is big. \\nBig people are rough. \\nAll rough people are green.\\nAnswer: T\\nQ2: Dave is blue. True/false?\\nLess inspiring\\nFigure 1: Questions in RuleTaker involve logical\\nreasoning with facts and rules.\\nFigure 1, the difficulty in judging logical problems\\narises not only from the process of reasoning but\\nalso from the choice of facts and rules to use as a\\nstarting point. Even if we were provided the thought\\nprocess for some of the issues, it would not be very\\nbeneficial for others, based on how we previously\\ncreated the prompts.\\nIn this paper, we propose Hypothesis Testing\\nPrompting, a new and more considerate prompt\\ntemplate design idea. Hypothesis testing is a for-\\nmal procedure for investigating our ideas about\\nthe world using statistics and is often used by sci-\\nentists to test specific predictions (Bevans, 2022).\\nWe draw inspiration from its process to introduce a\\nprocess of conclusion assumptions, backward rea-\\nsoning, and fact verification. Experiments on Rule-\\nTaker (Clark et al., 2020) and ProofWriter (Tafjord\\net al., 2021) show the effectiveness of our novel\\nprompting paradigm as a strategy for promoting\\ndeductive reasoning in large language models. Fur-\\nther analyses show that Hypothesis Test prompting\\ngenerates more desirable intermediate processes\\narXiv:2405.06707v1  [cs.CL]  9 May 2024\\nand significantly improves the \"Unknown\" label.\\n2.\\nRelated Work\\n2.1.\\nFew-Shot Prompting\\nBrown et al. (2020) propose in-context learning as\\nan alternative few-shot prompting way to stimulate\\nability. Besides, chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,\\n2022b) is one of the most well-known works, which\\ndecomposes the problem into intermediate steps\\nand further improves the ability of large language\\nmodels. Subsequently, several follow-up works\\nwere carried out, including Zero-shot-CoT (simply\\nadding \"Let’s think step by step\" before each an-\\nswer) (Kojima et al., 2022), Self-consistency (Wang\\net al., 2022), complexity-based (Fu et al., 2022),\\nand other prompting work (Liu et al., 2023b; Jung\\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Saparov and He,\\n2022). While these methods enhance the perfor-\\nmance of inference by paying attention to indica-\\ntions of the reasoning process, they often overlook\\nsome aspects such as identifying the root cause of\\nthe problem, establishing efficient reasoning strate-\\ngies, and determining the direction of logical rea-\\nsoning.\\n2.2.\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nDeductive reasoning is defined as the applica-\\ntion of general concepts to particular circum-\\nstances (Johnson-Laird, 2010). Making logical as-\\nsumptions is the foundation of deductive reasoning,\\nwhich then bases a conclusion on those assump-\\ntions. The deduction task is then applied to a sit-\\nuation from the actual world after starting with a\\nrule. In light of the principles \"All men are mortal.\"\\nand \"Socrates is a man.\" for example, we can draw\\nthe conclusion that \"Socrates is mortal.\" (Johnson-\\nLaird, 1999).\\n3.\\nHypothesis Testing Prompting\\nHypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investi-\\ngating our ideas about the world using statistics and\\nused by scientists to test specific predictions that\\narise from theories (Bevans, 2022; La et al., 2012).\\nThere are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:\\n1. State your research hypothesis;\\n2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hy-\\npothesis;\\n3. Perform an appropriate statistical test;\\n4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your\\nnull hypothesis;\\n5. Present the findings in your results and discus-\\nsion section;\\nWhen completing a challenging reasoning activ-\\nity, such as a multi-step deductive reasoning prob-\\nlem, one is not conducting random reasoning to\\nobtain all possible intermediate results. We shall\\nchoose the relevant conditions for inference ver-\\nification after initially making assumptions about\\nthe judgment problem, such as \" First assume the\\nconclusion is True and start from ... Then assume\\nthe conclusion is False and start from ... because\\nthe rules state that ... So the conclusion ...\". The\\npurpose of this study is to give language models\\nthe capacity to build a process that is similar to\\nwhat we defined as Hypothesis Testing Prompt-\\ning. We will show that large language models can\\ngenerate more appropriate thought and more ac-\\ncurate results if demonstrations of hypothesis test\\nprompting are provided in the exemplars for few-\\nshot prompting. Figure 2 shows an example of a\\nmodel producing a hypothesis testing thought to\\nsolve a deductive reasoning problem.\\n4.\\nExperiment\\n4.1.\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe explore Hypothesis Test Prompting for Chat-\\nGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo in the OpenAI API) on multiple\\nlogical reasoning benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. Considering FOL reasoning in\\nquestion answering systems, there are two world\\nassumptions (Reiter, 1981) that result in different\\nobjectives. One is the closed world assumption\\n(CWA), which is the presumption that what is not\\ncurrently known to be entailment is contradiction.\\nThe other is the open world assumption (OWA),\\nwhose objective should distinguish false proposi-\\ntions from uncertain ones. Due to differences in\\nworld assumptions, our analysis and solutions are\\nalso different.\\nWe consider the following two deductive reason-\\ning problem benchmarks: (1) the RuleTaker (Clark\\net al., 2020) benchmark using CWA assumption;\\n(2) the ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021) benchmark\\nusing OWA assumption. Both datasets are divided\\ninto five parts, each part requiring 0, ≤1, ≤2, ≤\\n3, and ≤5 hops of reasoning, respectively. We\\nconducted comparison tests on the test set of the\\ntwo datasets for 5 distinct hops.\\nStandard prompting. As one of the baselines,\\nwe take into account the common few-shot prompt-\\ning, made popular by Brown et al. (2020), in which\\na language model is provided with in-context ex-\\namples of input-output pairings before producing a\\nprediction for a test-time example. Examples are\\npresented in the form of questions and answers.\\nAs seen in Figure 2(above), the model directly an-\\nswers the question.\\nChain-of-Thought prompting.

Five students are required to\\nmanually evaluate the outcomes of the intermediate\\nreasoning after we randomly picked 100 examples\\nfrom depth-5 of the ProofWriter. Proof accuracy rep-\\nresents the proportion where the inference process\\nhas been proven to be reasonable in the correct\\npart of data label prediction. We compare the re-\\nsults of Chian-of-Thought and Hypothesis Testing\\nprompting and report in Figure 4(a). While Hy-\\npothesis Testing prompting mostly produced the\\ncorrect intermediate reasoning process when the\\npredicted label was correct, CoT only generated\\nthe correct chain for 26% of the examples. This\\nresult is in line with other research showing that\\nLMs rely on spurious correlations when solving log-\\nical problems from beginning to end. Additionally,\\nour approach can successfully increase reason-\\ning’s rationality. In processing the \"Unknown\" label,\\nHypothesis Testing prompting performs noticeably\\nbetter than Chain-of-Thought.\\n\"Unknown\" accuracy.\\nIn the ProofWriter\\ndataset, we separately counted the accuracy of\\nthe \"Unknown\" label shown in Figure 4(b). The\\nresults point to a flaw in the Chain-of-Thought strat-\\negy’s handling of \"Unknown\" labels(only 0.3 accu-\\nracyies). Contrarily, Hypothesis Testing prompting\\nsignificantly increases the reliability of judging this\\nlabel (up to 0.65). This further illustrates the value\\nof holding various assumptions, as well as the re-\\nverse confirmation of conclusions.\\n5.\\nConclusion\\nWe have investigated Hypothesis Testing prompt-\\ning as a straightforward and widely applicable tech-\\nnique for improving deductive reasoning in large\\nlanguage models. Multiple assumptions are made\\nduring hypothesis testing, and conclusions are\\nreverse-validated to arrive at the one and only ac-\\ncurate answer. Through experiments on two logical\\nreasoning datasets, we find that Hypothesis Test-\\ning prompting allows large language models to con-\\nstruct reasoning more reasonably and accurately.\\nWe anticipate that additional research on language-\\nbased reasoning approaches will be stimulated by\\nour novel prompting design strategy.\\n6.\\nReferences\\nAlfred V.

While the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs, (i.e. their capacity to\\nfollow instructions in reasoning tasks), have\\nreceived considerable attention, their abilities\\nin true inductive reasoning remain largely unex-\\nplored. To investigate the true inductive reason-\\ning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel\\nframework, SolverLearner. This framework\\nenables LLMs to learn the underlying function\\n(i.e., 𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps input data points\\n(𝑥) to their corresponding output values (𝑦),\\nusing only in-context examples. By focusing\\non inductive reasoning and separating it from\\nLLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate\\nand investigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in\\nits pure form via SolverLearner. Our observa-\\ntions reveal that LLMs demonstrate remarkable\\ninductive reasoning capabilities through Solver-\\nLearner, achieving near-perfect performance\\nwith ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly, de-\\nspite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to relatively lack deductive reason-\\ning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” reasoning.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecent years have witnessed notable progress in\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) with the de-\\nvelopment of Large Language Models (LLMs) like\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and ChatGPT (Ope-\\nnAI, 2023). While these models exhibit impressive\\nreasoning abilities across various tasks, they face\\nchallenges in certain domains. For example, a re-\\ncent study (Wu et al., 2023) has shown that while\\nLLMs excel in conventional tasks (e.g., base-10\\narithmetic), they often experience a notable decline\\nin accuracy when dealing “counterfactual” reason-\\ning tasks that deviate from the conventional cases\\nseen during pre-training (e.g., base-9 arithmetic).\\nIt remains unclear whether they are capable of fun-\\ndamental reasoning, or just approximate retrieval.\\nIn light of this, our paper seeks to investigate\\nthe reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Reasoning\\ncan encompasses two types: deductive reasoning\\nand inductive reasoning, as depicted in Fig. 1. De-\\nductive reasoning starts with a general hypothesis\\nand proceeds to derive specific conclusions about\\nindividual instances while inductive reasoning in-\\nvolves formulating broad generalizations or princi-\\nples from a set of instance observations. Despite\\nextensive research into the reasoning capabilities of\\nLLMs, most studies have not clearly differentiated\\nbetween inductive and deductive reasoning. For in-\\nstance, arithmetic reasoning task primarily focuses\\non comprehending and applying mathematical con-\\ncepts to solve arithmetic problems, aligning more\\nwith deductive reasoning. Yet, when employing\\nin-context learning for arithmetic reasoning tasks,\\nwhere the model is prompted with a few 〈input,\\noutput〉examples, the observed improvements are\\noften attributed to their inductive reasoning capac-\\nity. This fusion of reasoning types poses a critical\\nquestion: Which is the more significant limita-\\ntion in LLM reasoning, deductive or inductive\\nreasoning?\\nTo explore this question, it’s crucial to differen-\\ntiate between deductive and inductive reasoning.\\nCurrent methods that investigate deductive and in-\\nductive reasoning often rely on disparate datasets,\\nmaking direct comparisons challenging (Xu et al.,\\n2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Dalvi et al., 2021; Han\\net al., 2022; Sinha et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). To\\novercome this limitation, we have designed a set of\\ncomparative experiments that utilize a consistent\\ntask across different contexts, each emphasizing\\narXiv:2408.00114v2  [cs.AI]  7 Aug 2024\\n(b) Few-shot IO w/\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where\\nthe digits are \"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(a) Zero-shot\\nQ: Assuming that all numbers are in\\nbase-8 where the digits are\\n\"01234567\", what is 36+33?\\xa0\\nA:\\n(Output) 71\\nDeductive Reasoning\\nInductive Reasoning\\nGeneral Principle\\nSpecific Conclusion\\nThe result for\\xa036+33 is 71.\\nGeneral\\xa0➔\\xa0Specific\\nDeductive\\nReasoning\\n(c) Few-shot IO w/o\\xa0Mapping Function\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the\\nbase of which is unknown,\\xa0what is 36+33?\\nA:\\n(Output) The result for 36+33 is 71.\\n(d) SolverLearner\\nQ:\\xa0You are asked to add two numbers, the base of which is unknown, what is 57+27?\\nA:\\xa0The result for 57+27 is 106.\\nQ:\\xa0What is the function to map the input to the output?\\nA:\\n(Output)\\xa0def solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\\\n # Let\\'s analyze the given examples to find\\nthe base\\\\n # 57 + 27 = 106\\\\n\\xa0# It seems like the base is 8 (octal)\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the\\ninput strings to integers in base 8\\\\n num1 = int(n1, 8)\\\\n num2 = int(n2, 8)\\\\n\\\\n #\\nCalculate the sum\\\\n result = num1 + num2\\\\n\\\\n # Convert the result back to a string in\\nbase 8\\\\n return oct(result)[2:]\\nAddition in base 8\\nBegin from the rightmost digit, perform the addition.

As we move from left\\nto right across the figure, the methods gradually transition their primary focus from deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning.\\nSpecifically, method (a) is designed to demonstrate the LLMs’ deductive reasoning in its pure form. Conversely, method (c)\\nutilizes Input-Output (IO) prompting strategies, which are prevalent for probing the inductive reasoning skills of LLMs. However,\\nwe can observe that methods (c) cannot fully disentangle inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning as their learning process\\ndirectly moves from observations to specific instances, blurring the lines between the two. To exclusively focus on and examine\\ninductive reasoning, we introduce a novel framework called SolverLearner, positioned at the far right of the spectrum.\\neither deductive (i.e., methods (a) and (b)) or induc-\\ntive reasoning (i.e., methods (c) and (d)), as depicted\\nin Fig 1. For instance, in an arithmetic task, the pro-\\nficiency of a LLM in deductive reasoning depends\\non its ability to apply a given input-output mapping\\nfunction to solve problems when this function is\\nexplicitly provided. Conversely, an LLM’s skill\\nin inductive reasoning is measured by its ability\\nto infer these input-output mapping functions (i.e.,\\n𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦), based solely on\\nin-context examples. The base system often serves\\nas the input-output mapping function in an arith-\\nmetic task. In line with the aforementioned setup,\\nwe employ four methods to investigate the reason-\\ning capacity of LLMs. As we move from left to\\nright across Fig. 1, the methods gradually transition\\ntheir primary focus from deductive reasoning to\\ninductive reasoning. Method (a), at the far left of\\nthe figure, aims to explore the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs in its pure form, where no in-\\ncontext-learning examples are provided (zero-shot\\nsettings). While exploring deductive reasoning in\\nits pure form appears relatively straightforward in\\nzero-shot settings, untangling inductive reasoning\\nposes more significant challenges. Recent studies\\nhave investigated the inductive reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gendron et al., 2023;\\nXu et al., 2023b), they have primarily used Input-\\nOutput (IO) prompting (Mirchandani et al., 2023),\\nwhich involves providing models with a few 〈in-\\nput, output〉as demonstrations without providing\\nthe underlying mapping function.\\nThe models\\nare then evaluated based on their ability to han-\\ndle unseen examples, as illustrated in method (c).\\nThese studies often find LLMs facing difficulties\\nwith inductive reasoning. Our research suggests\\nthat the use of IO prompting might not effectively\\nseparate LLMs’ deductive reasoning skills from\\ntheir inductive reasoning abilities. This is because\\nthe approach moves directly from observations to\\nspecific instances, obscuring the inductive reason-\\ning steps. Consequently, the underperformance in\\nthe context of inductive reasoning tasks may be\\nattributed to poor deductive reasoning capabilities,\\ni.e., the ability of LLMs to execute tasks, rather than\\nbeing solely indicative of their inductive reasoning\\ncapability.\\nTo disentangle inductive reasoning from deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we propose a novel model, referred\\nto as SolverLearner. Given our primary focus on in-\\nductive reasoning, SolverLearner follows a two-step\\nprocess to segregate the learning of input-output\\nmapping functions from the application of these\\nfunctions for inference. Specifically, functions are\\napplied through external interpreters, such as code\\ninterpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning.\\nWe evaluate the performance of several LLMs\\nacross various tasks. LLMs consistently demon-\\nstrate remarkable inductive reasoning capabilities\\nthrough SolverLearner, achieving near-perfect per-\\nformance with ACC of 1 in most cases. Surprisingly,\\ndespite their strong inductive reasoning abilities,\\nLLMs tend to exhibit weaker deductive capabilities,\\nparticularly in terms of “counterfactual” reasoning.\\nThis finding, though unexpected, aligns with the\\nprevious research (Wu et al., 2023). In a zero-shot\\nscenario, the ability of an LLM to correctly exe-\\ncute tasks by applying principles (i.e. deductive\\nreasoning) heavily relies on the frequency with\\nwhich the model was exposed to the tasks during\\nits pre-training phase.\\n2\\nTask Definition\\nOur research is focused on a relatively unexplored\\nquestion: Which presents a greater challenge to\\nLLMs - deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning?\\nTo explore this, we designed a set of comparative\\nexperiments that apply a uniform task across var-\\nious contexts, each emphasizing either deductive\\nor inductive reasoning. The primary distinction\\nbetween the deductive and inductive settings is\\nwhether we explicitly present input-output map-\\npings to the models. Informally, we can describe\\nthese mappings as a function 𝑓𝑤: 𝑋→𝑌, where\\nan input 𝑥∈𝑋is transformed into an output 𝑦∈𝑌.\\nWe distinguish between the deductive and inductive\\nsettings as follows:\\n• Deductive setting: we provide the models with\\ndirect input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\n• Inductive setting: we offer the models a few\\nexamples (i.e., (𝑥, 𝑦) pairs) while intentionally\\nleaving out input-output mappings (i.e., 𝑓𝑤).\\nFor example, consider arithmetic tasks, where the\\nbase system is the input-output mapping function.\\nThe two approaches on the left side of Fig. 1 (i.e.,\\nmethod (a) and (b)) follow the deductive setting,\\nillustrating the case where the arithmetic base is\\nexplicitly provided. In contrast, the two methods\\n(i.e., method (c) and (d)) on right side of Fig. 1\\nadhere to the inductive setting, depicting the sce-\\nnario characterized by the absence of a specified\\narithmetic base, while a few input-output examples\\nare provided for guidance.\\n3\\nOur Framework for Inductive\\nReasoning: SolverLearner\\nWhile recent studies have explored the inductive\\nreasoning abilities of LLMs (Yang et al., 2022; Gen-\\ndron et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b), they have primar-\\nily relied on Input-Output (IO) prompting (Mirchan-\\ndani et al., 2023). This method involves providing\\nmodels with a few 〈input, output〉demonstrations\\nand then evaluating their performance on unseen\\nexamples, as depicted in method (c) in Fig. 1. Our\\nresearch suggests that the use of IO prompting and\\ndirectly evaluating the final instance performance\\nmight not effectively separate LLMs’ deductive\\nreasoning skills from their inductive reasoning abil-\\nities. This is because the approach moves directly\\nfrom observations to specific instances, obscuring\\nthe inductive reasoning steps. To better disentangle\\ninductive reasoning, we propose a novel framework,\\nSolverLearner. This framework enables LLMs to\\nlearn the function (i.e., 𝑦= 𝑓𝑤(𝑥)), that maps in-\\nput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦), using only in-context examples. By\\nfocusing on inductive reasoning and setting aside\\nLLM-based deductive reasoning, we can isolate and\\ninvestigate inductive reasoning of LLMs in its pure\\nform via SolverLearner. SolverLearner includes\\ntwo-stages as illustrated in Fig. 2:\\n• Function Proposal: In this initial phase, we\\npropose a function, that could be used to map\\ninput data points (𝑥) to their corresponding output\\nvalues (𝑦). This is corresponding to the inductive\\nreasoning process.\\n• Function Execution: In the second phase, the\\nproposed function is applied through external\\ncode interpreters to solve the test queries for\\nevaluation purposes. This phase ensures that\\nthe LLM is fully prevented from engaging in\\ndeductive reasoning.\\n3.1\\nFramework\\nIn this subsection, we will take the arithmetic task\\nas a case study to demonstrate the entire process.\\nFunction Proposal: Given the in-context ex-\\namples, the primary goal of LLMs is to learn a\\nfunction that can map input data points (𝑥) to their\\ncorresponding output values (𝑦). This process of\\nlearning the mapping between inputs and outputs\\nis akin to inductive reasoning, while employing\\nthe learned function to address unseen queries\\naligns with deductive reasoning. In order to sepa-\\nrate inductive reasoning from deductive reasoning,\\nthe execution of the learned function should be\\ncompletely detached from LLMs. To achieve this\\nseparation, external tools such as code interpreters\\nserve as efficient way to execute these functions in-\\ndependently. By encapsulating the learned function\\nwithin Python code, we can effectively detach the\\nduty of deductive reasoning from LLMs, assigning\\nThe result for 71+44 is 135.\\nThe result for 42+70 is 132.\\nThe result for 50+45 is 115.\\nThe result for 61+55 is 136.\\nThe result for 63+22 is 105.\\nThe result for 72+62 is 154.\\nThe result for 57+27 is 106.\\nThe result for 52+76 is 150.\\n8 Shot Examples\\nPython\\xa0Function\\n14+57\\n44+45\\n...\\n61+23\\n22+77\\nTest Queries\\n②\\xa0Function\\xa0\\nExecution\\n① Function\\nProposal\\nFigure 2: An overview of our framework SolverLearner for inductive reasoning. SolverLearner follows a two-step process to\\nsegregate the learning of input-output mapping functions from the application of these functions for inference. Specifically,\\nfunctions are applied through external code interpreters, to avoid incorporating LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\nit solely to these external executors. For instance,\\nin function proposal stage for an arithmetic task,\\nwe have:\\n“You are an expert mathematician and program-\\nmer. You are asked to add two numbers, the base\\nof which is unknown. Below are some provided\\nexamples: The result for 76+76 is 174.\\nPlease identify the underlying pattern to determine\\nthe base being used and implement a solver() func-\\ntion to achieve the goal.\\ndef solver(n1: str, n2: str) -> str:\\n# Let’s write a Python program step by step\\n# Each input is a number represented as a string.\\n# The function computes the sum of these numbers\\nand returns it as a string. ”\\nFunction Execution: In the second phase, func-\\ntions are executed through external code interpreters\\nto solve the test cases for evaluation purposes. These\\ncode interpreters act as “oracle” deductive reason-\\ners, fully preventing the LLM from involving deduc-\\ntive reasoning. This ensures that the final results\\nreflect only the inductive reasoning capability of the\\nLLM. To further decouple the LLM’s influence in\\nthis phase, test cases are generated using a template\\nwithout involving the LLM. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.1.3.\\n4\\nTasks\\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the\\ntasks under consideration. Our focus is on inves-\\ntigating the reasoning abilities of LLMs in both\\ndeductive and inductive reasoning scenarios. To\\nensure a robust evaluation, we carefully select tasks\\nthat lend themselves well to comparison. Firstly, to\\nprevent LLMs from reciting tasks seen frequently\\nduring pre-training, which could artificially inflate\\nperformance in deductive reasoning, a significant\\nportion of the tasks falls into the category of “coun-\\nterfactual reasoning” tasks. Secondly, in the context\\nof inductive reasoning, where only a few in-context\\nexamples are available without the mapping func-\\ntion, our objective is to learn the function that\\nmaps inputs to outputs based on this restricted\\ndataset. To achieve this, we choose tasks that are\\nwell-constrained, ensuring the existence of a single,\\nunique function capable of fitting this limited data.\\nDetailed descriptions of each task and the prompts\\nused can be found in Appendix A.1 and A.2.\\nArithmetic In this study, we focus on the two-\\ndigit addition task previously explored in the work\\nof\\nWu et al. (2023).\\nWe investigate multiple\\nnumerical bases, specifically base-8, 9, 10, 11, and\\n16 where base 10 corresponds to the commonly\\nobserved case during pretraining. In the context of\\ndeductive reasoning, the base is explicitly provided\\nwithout any accompanying in-context examples,\\nand the LLM is expected to perform the addition\\ncomputation by relying on its inherent deductive\\nreasoning abilities. Conversely, in the context of\\ninductive reasoning, instead of explicitly providing\\nthe base information to LLMs, we provide LLMs\\nsolely with few-shot examples and require them\\nto induce the base through these examples and\\nsubsequently generate a function to solve arithmetic\\nproblems.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In this setting, we\\nconcentrate on tasks related to syntactic recognition\\npreviously explored by Wu et al. (2023). Our\\nobjective is to evaluate LLMs using artificially\\nconstructed English sentences that vary from the\\nconventional subject-verb-object (SVO) word order.\\nFor deductive reasoning, we directly provide the\\nnew word order to LLMs without any contextual\\nexamples, challenging them to identify the subject,\\nverb, and object within this artificial language. In\\ncontrast, for inductive reasoning, we do not give\\nexplicit instructions on the changes in word order.\\nInstead, we introduce sentence pairs where one\\nsentence follows the standard word order, and the\\nother follows a modified sequence. Through this\\nsetting, LLMs are expected to learn the specific\\nchanges made to the word order and then apply this\\nlearned rule to identify the subject, verb, and object\\nwithin new sentences.\\nSpatial Reasoning In this task, we investigate\\nthe spatial reasoning previously investigated by Wu\\net al. (2023). Our specific focus is on modifying\\nthe direction-unit vector mapping and determining\\nthe object coordinates in this revised system. We\\nexplore multiple systems, starting with the com-\\nmonly observed case during pretraining, where up\\ncorresponds to north, down to south, left to west,\\nand right to east. This is compared to coordinate\\nsystems with swapped, rotated, and randomly per-\\nmuted axes. For deductive reasoning, we directly\\nprovide the direction-unit vector mapping without\\nany contextual examples, requiring LLMs to com-\\npute the object coordinates within these systems.\\nConversely, in the context of inductive reasoning, in-\\nstead of directly explaining the changes made to the\\ndirection-unit vector mapping to LLMs, we present\\nLLMs with a few example shots and challenge them\\nto infer the changes made to the mapping. They\\nare then expected to apply this learned function to\\ndetermine the object coordinates in the system.\\nCipher Decryption Under this scenario, we ex-\\nplore an innovative task that we have created, con-\\ncentrating on the decryption of strings encrypted\\nusing specific cipher systems. We have incorpo-\\nrated three particular cipher systems for this ex-\\nploration: the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. For deduc-\\ntive reasoning, we directly inform LLMs about the\\ncipher system being used, yet we do not offer any\\ncontextual examples. The objective for LLMs is to\\ndecode strings according to these cipher systems.\\nConversely, in the inductive reasoning scenario, our\\ntask involves providing LLMs with several exam-\\nples, each consisting of an encrypted string and\\nits decrypted version. The main challenge for the\\nmodels in this scenario is first to identify what ci-\\npher system was used and then to apply that cipher\\nsystem to decrypt an unseen string.\\n5\\nResults\\nFor each task, we evaluate our proposed Solver-\\nLearner for pure LLM inductive reasoning and\\nother settings using two different models, gpt-3.5-\\nturbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview, which are de-\\nnoted as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively. Since\\nboth methods are closed-source, we do not provide\\nspecific information about their size, architecture,\\nand pre-training particulars. Our experiments pri-\\nmarily focus on investigating the reasoning abilities\\nof LLMs in both deductive and inductive reasoning\\nscenarios. Therefore, we structure our evaluation\\nacross two distinct settings to highlight each type\\nof reasoning. The formal definition of each setting\\nis provided in Sec. 2. For the deductive setting, two\\nmethods are proposed for investigation:\\n• Zero-shot evaluates deductive reasoning ability\\nof the LLMs in its pure form. It tests the LLM’s\\nability to conclude information about specific\\nindividuals based solely on instructions, without\\nrelying on examples.\\n• 8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF) follows the\\ndeductive setting but enhances LLM reasoning\\nfurther by incorporating in-context examples. It\\naligns with the most commonly used prompt\\nmethods for enabling LLM reasoning. With the\\ninclusion of in-context examples, this approach\\ncan be seen as leveraging inductive reasoning to\\naugment deductive reasoning.\\nFor the inductive setting, we propose two methods\\nfor evaluation:\\n• 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) aligns with\\ntraditional input-output (IO) prompting methods\\nwidely used to investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapability of LLMs. However, as this method\\nproceeds directly from a set of observations to\\nspecific target instances, it remains intertwined\\nwith LLM-based deductive reasoning.\\n• 8-shot SolverLearner corresponds to our pro-\\nposed framework for inductive reasoning, capable\\nof evaluating inductive reasoning ability of the\\nLLMs in its pure form. It segregates the learning\\nof input-output mapping functions from the ap-\\nplication of these functions for inference, thereby\\npreventing the blend of LLM-based deductive\\nreasoning into the process.\\nBesides using 8-shot examples, our study also in-\\ncludes experiments with 16-shot examples to assess\\nhow changes in the number of in-context examples\\nimpact the results.

Fur-\\nthermore, we conduct an ablation study concerning\\nour proposed SolverLearner in Appendix A.5 for\\ndeeper insights into its functionality.\\n5.1\\nMain Results\\nThe results for all tasks are presented from Fig. 3\\nthrough Fig. 5. Specifically, Fig. 3 concentrates on\\ncomparing performances in the deductive setting,\\nwhile Fig. 4 examines comparisons in the inductive\\nsetting. Additionally, Fig. 5 focuses on contrasting\\nthe models’ capabilities across deductive and induc-\\ntive setting. For further reference, the prompts used\\nfor all tasks are included in Appendix A.2, and the\\nfull numerical results can be found in Appendix A.3.\\nLLMs exhibit poor deductive reasoning capa-\\nbilities, particularly in “counterfactual” tasks.\\nWe include two methods in Fig. 3, Zero-shot and\\n8-IO w/ Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate the\\ndeductive reasoning capability of LLMs. Our obser-\\nvations reveal that LLMs exhibit relatively weaker\\ndeductive capabilities, especially in “counterfac-\\ntual” tasks, while showing prowers in standard\\ntasks like base-10 arithmetic.\\nThis aligns with\\nfindings reported in (Wu et al., 2023). Integration\\nof in-context examples notably enhances LLMs’\\nperformance in various scenarios, suggesting that\\ntheir improvement stems from the acquisition of\\nknowledge through inductive reasoning from these\\nexamples. This further confirms the exceptional\\ninductive reasoning abilities of LLMs. This com-\\nbined evidence suggests that LLMs face challenges\\nin precisely following instructions and executing\\ncommands, especially when those instructions are\\nrelate to scenarios rarely encountered during their\\npre-training phase.\\nLLMs demonstrate remarkable inductive rea-\\nsoning capabilities through SolverLearner. We\\ninclude two methods in Fig. 4, SolverLearner (Ours)\\nand 8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF), to illustrate\\nthe inductive reasoning capability of LLMs. While\\n8-IO w/o Mapping Function (MF) struggles with\\ninductive reasoning, SolverLearner consistently\\nachieves perfect performance with an accuracy of\\n1 across all the cases with GPT-4 and succeeds in\\nmost cases when used with GPT-3.5. This discrep-\\nancy arises because the utilization of IO prompting\\nto directly reach conclusions on target instances may\\nnot effectively distinguish between LLMs’ deduc-\\ntive and inductive reasoning skills. By completely\\ndisentangling the inductive reasoning of LLMs,\\nour proposed SolverLearner shows the remarkable\\ninductive reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.\\nIt is also noteworthy that the efficacy of LLMs’\\ninductive reasoning capability heavily depends on\\nthe foundational model, with GPT-4 consistently\\noutperforming GPT-3.5.\\nDeductive reasoning presents a greater chal-\\nlenge than inductive reasoning for LLMs. To\\ncompare the challenges of the deductive reasoning\\ncapability with the inductive reasoning capability\\nof LLMs, we include two methods in Fig. 1, Solver-\\nLearner and Zero-shot, demonstrating pure induc-\\ntive and deductive reasoning abilities. Since the\\nentire reasoning involves two steps: first, obtaining\\nthe input-output function ( 𝑓𝑤), which corresponds\\nto inductive reasoning, and second, applying the\\nfunction for inference, which corresponds to deduc-\\ntive reasoning. Once both steps are successfully\\ncompleted, perfect performance is observed, as\\nindicated by the dotted line in the figure. Zero-\\nshot can be seen as replacing the first step with\\nan oracle, with deductive reasoning capability of\\nLLMs to be studied, while SolverLearner can be\\nseen as replacing the second step with an oracle,\\nwith inductive reasoning capability of LLMs to be\\nstudied. By comparing the gaps of SolverLearner\\nand Zero-shot towards perfect reasoning, we can\\nobserve that in most cases, LLMs can complete the\\ninductive step perfectly, while they rarely achieve\\nperfect performance on the deductive step. This in-\\ndicates that in LLM reasoning, deductive reasoning\\npresents a greater challenge. Note that we avoid to\\nphrasing it as directly comparing inductive and de-\\nductive reasoning capabilities. Instead, we examine\\nwhether the gaps mainly come from inductive or\\ninductive reasoning, considering that LLMs could\\nnot achieve perfect counterfactual reasoning.\\n5.2\\nMore Results over Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclusion,\\nwe have included results over additional LLMs,\\nclaude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted\\nas Claude3.\\nDue to space limitations, the full\\nnumerical results are provided in Appendix A.4.\\n5.3\\nAblation Study\\nWe conducted several experiments to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of our framework, detailed in the ab-\\nlation studies in Appendix A.5. These experiments\\ninclude investigating the effects of programs exe-\\ncuted by a Python interpreter v.s. natural language\\nexecuted by an LLM and examining the impact of\\nthe number of in-context learning examples.\\n6\\nRelated Works\\n6.1\\nIn-Context Learning\\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) has demonstrated its\\neffectiveness in learning from a few demonstration\\nexamples and solve previously unseen tasks with-\\nout requiring updates to its model parameters (Wei\\net al., 2022a). This remarkable capability is com-\\nmonly referred to as the “in-context learning ability”\\nof language models. It implies that the LLMs can\\nleverage its existing knowledge and generalize from\\na few demonstration examples to solve new, related\\ntasks (Dong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Rubin et al.,\\n2021; Gonen et al., 2022). Some notable works\\ninclude chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei\\net al., 2022b), which elicits reasoning with inter-\\nmediate steps in few-shot exemplars. Built upon\\nthe CoT framework, several works expand CoT by\\norganizing and processing thoughts using more\\ncomplex structures, such as trees (Yao et al., 2023)\\nand graphs (Besta et al., 2023) or breaking a prob-\\nlem into sub problems and then proceeds to solve\\neach one independently (Zhou et al., 2022). While\\nthese studies have effectively improved the reason-\\ning capability of LLMs, they have failed to clearly\\ndistinguish between inductive and deductive reason-\\ning, let alone investigate which represents a more\\ncritical limitation for LLM reasoning capabilities:\\ndeductive reasoning or inductive reasoning.\\n6.2\\nExploring LLMs’ Reasoning Skills\\nDespite the impressive achievements of LLMs in\\nvarious reasoning tasks, the underlying mechanisms\\nof their reasoning capabilities remain a subject of\\ndebate. The question of whether LLMs genuinely\\nreason in a manner akin to human cognitive pro-\\ncesses or merely simulate aspects of reasoning\\nwithout true comprehension is still open (Huang\\nand Chang, 2022).\\nFor instance, Kojima et al.\\nhave suggested that LLMs exhibit commendable\\nzero-shot reasoning abilities, implying that these\\nmodels can draw logical conclusions in scenarios\\nthey have not been explicitly trained on (Kojima\\net al., 2022). However, some researchers cast doubt\\non the reasoning capability of LLMs. While ap-\\nproaches like the chain-of-thought method may\\nmimic human-like thought processes, it remains\\nuncertain whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in\\nreasoning or simply following patterns learned dur-\\ning training (Wei et al., 2022b; Valmeekam et al.,\\n2022). Additionally, there’s a debate regarding\\nwhether LLMs are symbolic reasoners (Tang et al.,\\n2023) or possess strong abstract reasoning capa-\\nbilities (Gendron et al., 2023). In light of these\\nseemingly contradictory conclusions, our research\\naims to investigate deeper into the reasoning capa-\\nbilities of LLMs. We intend to dissect the nuances\\nof inductive and deductive reasoning within the\\ncontext of LLMs, identifying which form of reason-\\ning presents a more significant challenge to their\\nreasoning abilities.\\n6.3\\nEquipping LLMs with External Tools\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have made signifi-\\ncant progress in utilizing tools through frameworks\\nlike CREATOR (Qian et al., 2023) and LATM (Cai\\net al., 2023), which allow LLMs to create tools\\nusing documentation and code. Logic-LM (Pan\\net al., 2023) integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers\\nto improve logical problem-solving, However, these\\napproaches focus exclusively on deductive reason-\\ning, aiming to enable LLMs to derive correct an-\\nswers for specific questions without incorporating\\nthe capacity for inductive reasoning to infer underly-\\ning mapping function shared by few-shot examples.\\nIn contrast, our primary objective is not to propose\\na new framework for using tools to enhance the\\nproblem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Instead, we\\naim to differentiate between deductive and inductive\\nreasoning within LLMs and explore which presents\\na greater challenge to their reasoning abilities.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nThis study aims to explore a less-investigated aspect\\nof LLMs: within LLM reasoning, which presents\\na greater challenge — deductive or inductive rea-\\nsoning?\\nTo investigate the inductive reasoning\\ncapacities of LLMs, we introduce a novel frame-\\nwork called SolverLearner. By concentrating on\\ninductive reasoning while setting aside LLM-based\\ndeductive reasoning, SolverLearner can scrutinize\\nthe pure form of inductive reasoning in LLMs.\\nOur findings unveil remarkable inductive reasoning\\nprowers in LLMs through SolverLearner, achieving\\nnear-perfect performance with an ACC of 1 in most\\ncases. Surprisingly, despite their strong inductive\\nreasoning abilities, LLMs often exhibit weaker de-\\nductive capabilities, particularly in tasks involving\\n“counterfactual” scenarios.\\nLimitations\\nLLMs cannot perform inductive reasoning over\\nall the tasks In our inductive learning setting, LLMs\\nare provided with only a limited number of contex-\\ntual examples. The goal is to infer the function that\\naccurately maps inputs to outputs based solely on\\nthis constrained dataset. In order to solve this prob-\\nlem, it is significant that we can find a unique func-\\ntion satisfied given these examples. For instance, a\\nlinear function can be precisely determined given\\njust two data points, as it has a singular solution.\\nHowever, attempting to deduce a quadratic curve\\nfrom two points poses an insurmountable challenge\\ndue to the existence of infinite functions capable\\nof passing through those specific points. Addition-\\nally, LLMs might struggle to discern the correct\\nmapping function when the search space of the\\nproblem expands excessively. Consider the case\\nof arithmetic tasks; without limiting the search\\nspace to finding a suitable base that aligns with\\nthe observations, the task becomes overwhelmingly\\ncomplex. This is because the search space could en-\\ncompass any conceivable rule that accommodates\\nthe observations.\\nThe effectiveness of LLMs’ inductive reason-\\ning capability is heavily reliant on the founda-\\ntional model While GPT-4 consistently showcase\\nimpressive inductive reasoning abilities through\\nSolverLearner and achieve perfect performance\\nwith ACC of 1 across all the tasks, GPT-3.5 strug-\\ngle to learn the correct input-output mapping func-\\ntion in several cases. This observation suggests\\nthat the inductive reasoning potential of LLMs is\\nsignificantly constrained by the underlying model.\\nChain of Thought (COT) has not been incor-\\nporated into the comparison Chain of Thought\\n(COT) is a significant prompting technique designed\\nfor use with LLMs. Rather than providing a direct\\nanswer, COT elicits reasoning with intermediate\\nsteps in few-shot exemplars. This method was not\\nincorporated into our comparison as it is viewed\\nas a technique to improve the deductive reasoning\\ncapabilities of LLMs. Although COT has proven to\\nbe effective across various tasks, numerous studies\\nhighlight a significant performance gap that COT\\nstill needs to bridge to achieve flawless execution.\\nEthical Considerations\\nThe authors foresee no ethical concerns with the\\nresearch presented in this paper.\\nReferences\\nMaciej Besta, Nils Blach, Ales Kubicek, Robert Ger-\\nstenberger, Lukas Gianinazzi, Joanna Gajda, Tomasz\\nLehmann, Michal Podstawski, Hubert Niewiadomski,\\nPiotr Nyczyk, et al. 2023.

These expressions are\\ndrawn from bases 8, 9, 10, 11, and 16, with sepa-\\nrate sampling for each base. Importantly, all the\\nexpressions have been carefully chosen to yield\\ndistinct results when evaluated in their respective\\nbases, thereby distinguishing them from one another\\nduring the process of rule learning.\\nBasic Syntactic Reasoning In accordance with\\nthe methodology outlined in Wu et al.’s work (Wu\\net al., 2023), we have generated a set of 100 simple\\nthree-word sentences (e.g., “bob likes bananas”)\\nwith five different word order variations (e.g., “ba-\\nnanas bob likes” in OSV format). Subsequently,\\nwe tasked LLMs with learning how to manipulate\\nsentence order. It’s noteworthy that we took great\\ncare in selecting words to ensure that each word in\\na sentence can only fulfill one specific role, such as\\nsubject, object, or verb. For instance, we ensured\\nthat sentences like “bob likes anna” were excluded,\\nas both “bob” and “anna” could potentially serve as\\nboth subjects and objects, violating this constraint.\\nSpatial Reasoning The spatial reasoning dataset\\nintroduced in Wu et al.’s paper (Wu et al., 2023)\\nconsists of 100 rooms that were randomly selected,\\nand each room contains three distinct objects. The\\nspatial directions within these rooms are represented\\nusing unit vectors. For instance, north is represented\\nas (0, 1), south as (0, -1), east as (1, 0), and west\\nas (-1, 0), with a y-axis pointing upward serving\\nas the default orientation. In our study, we have\\nmodified the mapping between directions and unit\\nvectors and tasked LLMs with learning this new\\ndirection-to-unit vector relationship. We explore\\ntwo direction-swapped scenarios (north-south and\\neast-west), three rotated scenarios (by 90°, 180°,\\nand 270°), and a randomly permuted scenario. The\\nprimary metric we report is instance-level accuracy,\\nwhich necessitates that all three objects within a\\nroom must be correctly positioned in order to be\\nconsidered accurate.\\nCipher Decryption We’ve generated a collection\\nof 100 pairs of strings (e.g., “Mrxuqhb -> Journey”\\nfor Caesar Cipher) for each of three cipher systems,\\nincluding the Alphabetically Sorting Cipher the\\nCaesar Cipher and the Morse Cipher. Each pair\\ncomprises an encrypted string (e.g., “Mrxuqhb”)\\nand its corresponding decrypted version (e.g., “Jour-\\nney”). By providing LLMs with several examples,\\neach containing an encrypted string alongside its\\ncorresponding decrypted counterpart, the primary\\ntask is to accurately determine the cipher system\\nemployed in an open-world context.\\nA.1.2\\nFew shot Example Generation\\nThe preparation of examples for few-shot learning\\nfollows a straightforward process. We divide all the\\ndata into a training set and a test set, from which few-\\nshot examples are extracted from the training set.\\nThese few-shot examples are automatically prepared\\nby associating queries with their corresponding\\nground truth answers using a pre-defined template.\\nA.1.3\\nTest Case Generation\\nIn the function execution phase, the test cases are\\ngenerated using a template without involving LLM.\\nIn particular, the test cases are drawn from the test\\ndata files, containing all the queries along with\\ntheir correct answers (e.g., “76+76 = 174”). When\\nthe LLM is used for generating code, we specify\\na function interface, such as def solver(n1: str,\\nn2: str) -> str. Then, using the query examples\\nprovided, like “76+76 = 174”, we create test cases\\nby applying this function interface to the query (e.g.,\\nsolver(76,76)), thereby eliminating any reliance on\\nLLM for this process. This method ensures that our\\ntest case generation is 100% correct.\\nA.2\\nFull Prompts\\nWe provide the prompts that we used to query the\\nLLMs for all tasks in Tables 1 to 4. We do not use\\nthe system message field for any model.\\nA.3\\nFull Results\\nWe show the full numerical results in Tables 5 to 8.\\nIn addition to using 8-shot examples, these results\\nalso include experiments with 16-shot examples\\nto assess how changes in the number of in-context\\nexamples impact the results.\\nA.4\\nMore Results on Additional LLMs\\nTo validate the generalizability of our conclu-\\nsion, we have included additional LLMs, claude-\\n3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0, which is denoted as\\nClaude3. We show the full numerical results in\\nTables 9 to 12.\\nA.5\\nAblation studies\\nLLMs struggle as executors when applying\\nlearned functions. To better demonstrate the de-\\nductive capacity of LLM, we present both GPT-3.5\\nand Python with identical code and task them with\\napplying the code to deduce the same set of queries.\\nAs shown in Table 13, while the Python interpreter\\ncan be considered an oracle, delivering flawless\\nperformance, it proves challenging for LLMs to\\naccurately execute the code.\\nLLMs can learn the function with very few\\nexamples when the inductive reasoning problem\\nis well defined.\\nTo examine the impact of the\\nnumber of few-shot examples on the inductive rea-\\nsoning capability of LLMs, we vary the number of\\nin-context examples within [1,2,4,8,16] and assess\\nperformance on the spatial reasoning task using\\nGPT-3.5 as presented in Table 14. We observe that\\neven with very few examples, GPT-3.5 can still\\nlearn the mapping function if it is learnable.\\nTable 1: Prompts for the Arithmetic Task.\\nMode\\nPrompt\\nZero-shot\\nYou are a mathematician.
